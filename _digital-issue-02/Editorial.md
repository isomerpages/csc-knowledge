<em><small>ETHOS Digital Issue 02, Apr 2018</small></em>

<p>In this second issue of our <em>ETHOS Digital Edition</em>, we continue to bring you a variety of perspectives of interest to the practice of public sector governance and leadership in Singapore.&nbsp; </p>

<p>First, continuing on from our exploration of the future of work, we feature views from James A. Riccio&nbsp;from New York-based thinktank MDRC, who believes that sector-based training programmes can be designed to better benefit both workers and employers.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We also hear from veteran doctor and medical researcher Dean Schillinger, who argues that to combat diabetes we cannot rely on personal choices alone, but must look to addressing structural issues and whole-of-society measures.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In a similar vein, two young public officers&nbsp;reflect on the national narrative of self-reliance, and how it could be qualified with a greater sense of shared social responsibility. </p>

<p>Finally, contributors from our own Institute of Public Administration and Management at Civil Service College investigates the potential of civic crowdfunding&nbsp;as an option for funding small public projects.</p>

<p>As always, we wish you an engaging read and would love to hear from you if you have any comments or suggestions at <a href="mailto:ethos@cscollege.gov.sg">ethos@cscollege.gov.sg</a>.<br>
