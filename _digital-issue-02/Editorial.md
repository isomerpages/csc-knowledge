<p>In this second issue of our <em>ETHOS Digital Edition</em>, we continue to bring you a variety of perspectives of interest to the practice of public sector governance and leadership in Singapore.&nbsp; </p>

<p>First, continuing on from our exploration of the future of work, we feature views from <a href="/digital-issue-02/sector-based-training-that-works/"><em>James A. Riccio</em></a>&nbsp;from New York-based thinktank MDRC, who believes that sector-based training programmes can be designed to better benefit both workers and employers.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We also hear from veteran doctor and medical researcher<a href="/digital-issue-02/defeating-diabetes/"><em> Dean Schillinger</em></a>, who argues that to combat diabetes we cannot rely on personal choices alone, but must look to addressing structural issues and whole-of-society measures.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In a similar vein, two young public officers&nbsp;reflect on the national narrative of self-reliance, and how it could be qualified with a greater sense of <a href="/digital-issue-02/rethinking-responsibility/"><em>shared social responsibility.</em></a> </p>

<p>Finally, contributors from our own Institute of Public Administration and Management at Civil Service College investigates the <a href="/digital-issue-02/could-crowdfunding-work-for-singapores-public-sector/"><em>potential of civic crowdfunding</em></a>&nbsp;as an option for funding small public projects.</p>

<p>As always, we wish you an engaging read and would love to hear from you if you have any comments or suggestions at <a href="mailto:ethos@cscollege.gov.sg">ethos@cscollege.gov.sg</a>.<br>
