<p>In this issue of <em>ETHOS Digital Edition</em>, we continue to bring you a variety of perspectives of interest to the practice of public sector governance and leadership in Singapore. </p>

<p>Sharon Tham and Khanh Do, also from the IGP, report on a trial applying <a href="using-behavioural-insights-to-increase-charitable-donations.html">behavioural nudges to increase charitable donations</a>, with promising results.</p>

<p>When a manager or leader is appointed to a new position, there can be uncertainty for both the individual involved and the department or organisation to which they are posted.  Aaron Maniam offers <a href="five-tips-for-leadership-transitions.html">five tips to ease this transition process</a>. </p>

<p>Finally, the Ministry of Health highlights the outcomes of their use of a <a href="partnering-with-the-public-in-the-war-on-diabetes.html">Citizen’s Jury</a>&nbsp;to involve members of the public in the war on diabetes, through a deep, active and considered process. </p>

<p>As always, we wish you an engaging read and would love to hear from you if you have any comments or suggestions.  </p>
