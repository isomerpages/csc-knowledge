<h2>Challenges for a Future-facing Workforce</h2>

<p>In the past, a person’s career has been seen as a series of stepping stones, with time spent at each stone and stage. However, today’s careers are more like running on a moving treadmill. Regardless of age, you must continue to keep pace and learn lest you fall off when you stop.</p>

<p>Singapore’s latest labour market report indicates that there are more job vacancies than there are job seekers. The number of job vacancies has increased over the past two years, hitting a new high of 128,100 in March 2022<sup><a href="">1</a></sup>. This may have been an outcome of the ‘Great Resignation’: a global trend of people quitting their jobs since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to seek better work-life balance after a prolonged period of working remotely without commuting<sup><a href="">2</a></sup>.&nbsp; Anecdotally, I have found, from LinkedIn, that many of my connections have been moving to new jobs recently.</p>

<p>But there are also accounts of people who have been displaced but have yet to find new employment, due to a mismatch in their skills. In NTUC’s recent study “Continuing Education and Training (CET): Now and What Could be Next” with 564 business leaders, 63.1% of business leaders are concerned about skills mismatch (see <b>Table 1</b>)<sup><a href="">.3</a></sup></p>	

<img src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Digital_Issue_10/LifelongLearning_Table1.JPG">

<p>Adopting a mindset of lifelong learning is imperative to addressing the issue of skills mismatch. Singapore has made considerable strides towards the development of lifelong learning with our national movement, SkillsFuture Singapore, seeking to change how people view skills, jobs and learning. Singapore wants to develop a culture of lifelong learning, where people get satisfaction in life from learning at every stage regardless of where they start, satisfaction from mastering the skills, and satisfaction from being part of a community of learners. As the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew put it in his 1977 speech in Parliament, “an educated man is a man who never stops learning and wants to learn”.<sup><a href="">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Many other countries are also on a journey to help their citizens master skills throughout their careers and develop a culture of lifelong learning. With Singapore still at an early stage of our SkillsFuture journey, we have a lot to learn from others.<sup><a href="">5</a></sup> We have therefore looked at key strategies adopted—both in Singapore and in different parts of the world—to promote lifelong learning.</p>

<p>Based on our research, these can be encapsulated as the “5As”:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>A</b>ppropriate Balance between Training and Work</li>
	<li><b>A</b>ccess to Training for All Workers</li>
	<li><b>A</b>geing Workforce Investment</li>
	<li><b>A</b>pproaches to Foster Lifelong Learning</li>
	<li><b>A</b>dapting Education</li>
</ul>




<h2>Appropriate Balance Between Training and Work</h2>

<p>With the half-life of skills shortening, training is essential to allow every worker to expand their knowledge base, stay current, and enhance their job abilities. This is how they can be more productive in the workplace, helping them to stay employable and their companies to thrive. Research has shown that for up to three years following training,<sup><a href="">6</a></sup>&nbsp;business revenue is on average 0.7% higher for every 10% of the local workforce that was supported for training. Furthermore, our enterprises’ labour productivity has increased by 2.2% on average annually for two years.<sup><a href="">7</a></sup></p>

<p>In Singapore, our study on Continuing Education and Training<sup><a href="">8</a></sup>&nbsp;also shows that a majority of business leaders report observing positive changes in their workers post-training (<b>see Table 2</b>), such as higher working performance (84.2%), the ability to do additional or new job responsibilities (85.1%), and enhanced knowledge (87.6%).</p>


<img src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Digital_Issue_10/LifelongLearning_Table2.JPG">

<p>However, only 50.9% of business leaders had sent their workers for training in the past six months. Out of those who did send workers for training, on average only 33.6% of their workforce in the company attended the training. This suggests that 66.4% of workers in the company were missing out on training. Employers must find the appropriate balance between training and work for their workers, tilting towards greater workforce readiness, relevance, and resilience.</p>

<p>Notably, European governments have set a legal minimum requirement for training for all workers. For example, the Flexible and Workable Work Act in Belgium mandates that firms give every employee at least five days of training annually; Portugal’s legal requirement for paid training hours per year is 35 and the legal minimum is five days annually in Switzerland.<sup><a href="">9</a></sup></p>

<br>

<div class="break"><p>The least likely to train are those who most need it in order to get or keep a job.</p>
</div>

<h2>Access to Training for All Workers</h2>

<p>According to a study by the OECD on training and employment performance, measures geared at advancing employees’ skills have a positive impact on employment performance.<sup><a href="">10</a></sup>&nbsp;However, only over 20% of adults with low skills participated in training, compared to over 40% of adults with medium or high skills.<sup><a href="">11</a></sup>&nbsp; Older adults, lower-wage workers, employees of SMEs, temporary workers and the unemployed are the ones that typically fall behind in training and learning opportunities. The least likely to train are those who most need it in order to get or keep a job.</p>

<p>To address the issue of lack of training for workers who require it, Norway expanded their career counselling programme for workers.<sup><a href="">12</a></sup> Early career counselling in the educational process has the potential to minimise dropout rates and improve choices made in school. Seniors who receive career counselling are better able to adapt to the shifting skill demands in the labour market, leading to higher employment mobility and remaining longer in employment.</p>

<p>The study by Yang et al.<sup><a href="">13</a></sup>&nbsp; highlights that workers with skills gaps are not the top priority for training according to business leaders (see <b>Table 3)</b>. This puts a strain on the very workers who would have benefited from training. Therefore, we must allow greater access to training for all workers, especially workers with skills gaps and mature workers, to enhance their employment and employability, because every worker matters.</p>

<h2>Ageing Workforce Investment</h2>

<p>Many developed countries, such as Japan, are facing the issue of an ageing workforce. Japan has at least 30% of its population aged 60 and above. By the year 2050, 62 countries, including China, will reach that milestone.[14](https://www.csc.gov.sg/articles/lifelong-learning-through-a-global-lens#notes)&nbsp; To enhance the employability of mature workers, the United Kingdom introduced the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE)/Union mid-life career review initiative.<sup><a href="">15</a></sup></p>

<p>In the same vein, it is projected that 1 in 4 Singaporeans will be aged 65 or older by the year 2030.<sup><a href="">16</a></sup>&nbsp; The NTUC-SNEF PME taskforce, which I co-chaired, has found that mature PMEs, aged 40 to 60, face challenges such as difficulties in searching for suitable employment and are concerned about job security.[<sup><a href="">17</a></sup>&nbsp;More than 8 in 10 respondents have expressed difficulties in finding another job that matches their skills or interests. Hence, further investment should be made to support our people’s journey of lifelong learning, especially mid-careerists amid an ageing workforce.</p>

<h2>Effective Communication Ensures Stakeholder Participation in the Change Management Process</h2>
	
<div id="case1">	

<h4>Case 1: Effective communication of project change in a large-scale energy infrastructure project with multiple international stakeholder</h4>

<p>In the planning phase of the project, various project core teams consisting of participants from all key stakeholders groups were formed and maintained throughout the entire project life cycle. Communication routines and platforms between different project stakeholders were set up and made explicit.</p>

<p>This stable and well-organised system ensured the efficient flow of project information among the stakeholders, such as when changes had to be made to the scope of work. Clear and timely communication promoted stakeholder understanding and trust, allowing effective decisions on project changes to be made by the project core teams even during conflict situations.</p>

<p>The communication routines helped to maintain stakeholder engagement throughout the project life cycle, leading to positive outcomes for the project.</p><br>
	
</div>

	
<div id="case2">		
<h4>Case 2: Ineffective communication of project change in a small-scale facility development project with relatively short timeframe and limited budget</h4>

<p>In the planning phase of this construction project, different stakeholder groups came together to co-create project goals. However, during the technical planning and implementation phase, a more task-oriented approach was adopted, and work efficiency was preferred over required project functionality. Communications with the stakeholders was ad hoc.</p>

<p>In addition, required changes during the construction phase were not adequately communicated to key stakeholders, and decisions were made solely by the construction team. This was likely because the lack of clear and established communication routines created the perception that seeking input from the various stakeholders would be onerous.</p>

<p>As a result of these changes, the needs of some stakeholders who would be using the facility could not be met. This was only discovered during the final inspection of the premises, and the contractor then had to do additional work and installation.</p>

<p>The lack of clear and timely communication with key stakeholders resulted in decreasing stakeholder involvement and unsatisfactory project outcomes.</p>
	
</div>	
	
	
</div>

<p>In summary, any deprioritisation plan should include some consideration of how to manage the impact on various internal and external stakeholders. Deprioritisation is akin to a change process, and it is important to address not only the technical aspect of the situation but also people’s emotions and expectations. Otherwise, efforts at deprioritisation may be futile or even counterproductive.</p>
