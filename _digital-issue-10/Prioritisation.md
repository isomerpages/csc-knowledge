<p>
Prioritisation is an ever-present reality that we all face in the Public Service. To generate greater impact and the best public value, we must put our scarce resources to their best use. This often means we have to prioritise how we spend our money, time, and effort.</p>

<p>Decisions about prioritisation take place at different levels. Strategic decisions shape the overall direction and focus of an organisation, which have implications for departmental-level objectives. Decisions must then be made at the team and individual levels about how to prioritise between potentially new streams of work that are important to organisational strategy vis-Ã -vis continuing efforts on current projects and maintaining high standards in ongoing operations.</p>

<p>While we recognise the need to prioritise, it is not easy to do well in practice. Find out more about <a href="/files/prioritisation-challenges.pdf">the top 5 challenges that public service officers face with prioritisation.</a></p>
