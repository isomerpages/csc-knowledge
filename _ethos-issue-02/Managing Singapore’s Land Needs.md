<em><small>ETHOS Issue 02, Apr 2007</small></em>
<img src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_02/Managing_Singapore's_Land_Needs.jpg">



<p>Much has changed in Singapore's urban landscape in the four decades since Independence. In the 1960s, Singapore was beset by high unemployment, an overcrowded city centre, and a shortage of proper housing and adequate infrastructure. Today, the city centre is a bustling business and financial hub, with a vibrant mix of retail and entertainment activities catering to both residents and visitors. Good quality homes are readily available, in self-sufficient new towns and in the heart of the city. The island is served by an efficient transport system and high-quality infrastructure.</p>

<p>None of this occurred by chance. Singapore's unique circumstances and land limitations demand judicious, comprehensive and long-term planning. Planners in Singapore must ensure that all land use needs can be met, not only in the present but also in the longer term, in order to sustain growth and development in the years to come.</p>

<p>This is achieved through the Concept Plan, a strategic land use and transportation plan which sets out Singapore's development directions some 40 to 50 years ahead. The Concept Plan takes into consideration all major land use demands such as housing, industry and commerce, recreation and nature areas, transport and utility infrastructure, as well as defence requirements, and represents Singapore's planning strategies to make best use of its precious land resources. Many features of Singapore's physical landscape, such as new towns, the airport at Changi, the port at Pasir Panjang, the reclamation of Jurong Island for the petrochemical industry, its network of expressways and mass rapid transit lines, and business parks, are the result of earlier Concept Plans.</p>

<p>To prepare the Concept Plan, government agencies study long-term land requirements for various major land uses. This collective effort ensures that national priorities and strategic directions for various sectors are incorporated into the land use plan.</p>

<p>During the recent review of the 2001 Concept Plan, focus groups — comprising academics, interest group representatives, professionals and citizens — were formed as part of a public consultation exercise to gauge public values. Feedback from the general public was also considered. The consultation process highlighted the need to intensify housing and industrial areas, while retaining parks and identity areas as these provided a quality living environment. This exercise provided a clear indication of public aspirations for the future landscape of Singapore.</p>

<h3>FROM PLANNING TO IMPLEMENTATION</h3>

<p>The Master Plan translates the broad strategies of the Concept Plan into detailed plans to guide development over the next 10 to 15 years. It is a statutory land use plan showing the permissible land use and density for every parcel of land in Singapore. Planning approval is required for development projects from both the private and public sectors. This ensures that developments in Singapore are carried out in an orderly manner and in accordance with the intentions stipulated in the Master Plan.</p>

<p>Zoning of land for specific uses ensures that sufficient land is earmarked for different needs, in line with strategic directions. This is necessary because if left to the market, uses with higher commercial value could price out uses such as healthcare facilities or parks which are needed by the community. By ensuring that retail amenities and facilities such as libraries, sports facilities, schools, community centres and parks are accessible within housing estates, planning enhances the liveability of residential areas and reduces the need to travel.</p>


<div class="purple">

Since the release and development of sites is market-led, the pace of implementing new development areas depends on market demand and investor confidence in the real estate sector.
</h5>
</div>


<p>Stipulating the allowable use and intensity of land parcels provides a degree of certainty for estimating the provision needed for public infrastructure and facilities such as roads, drains, schools and hospitals. It also facilitates planning for the distribution and phasing of these amenities, and for coordinating their implementation. Furthermore, it gives certainty to owners and occupants regarding the land use or activities in their neighbourhood. Zoning also encourages the clustering of compatible uses: for example, sites are identified to meet the demand for hotel rooms in suitable locations such as within vibrant and interesting mixed-use belts along the Singapore River and Orchard Road.</p>

<p>New strategic areas are identified for development in the medium-term to meet business needs so that infrastructure can be put in place and demand channelled to develop these areas. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) co-ordinates the efforts of government agencies in infrastructure development to open up new areas such as Marina Bay. The Government Land Sales programme is an important tool for implementing development strategies and releasing land to meet the demand for various types of properties. It also facilitates the participation of the private sector in the development of Singapore. Since the release and development of sites is market-led, the pace of implementing new development areas depends on market demand and investor confidence in the real estate sector.</p>




<p class="small-text text">In land-scarce Singapore, land use planning involves trade-offs between many compelling priorities.</p>




<div class="purple1">


<h3 class="title">A BALANCING ACT</h3>
<h4>In land-scarce Singapore, land use planning involves trade-offs between many compelling priorities.</h4>
<p>An important principle of planning is to protect amenity by preventing uses with negative externalities (i.e., those that create nuisance or have a negative impact on others in the vicinity) from being inappropriately located. For instance, industrial activities which could be pollutive are prevented from operating in predominantly residential areas.</p>
<p>A balance also needs to be found between providing flexibility for businesses and facilitating development, and minimising adverse impact on neighbouring uses. White sites were introduced in 1995 to give developers greater flexibility by allowing commercial, residential, hotel or any mix of these compatible uses at suitable locations.<a href="#notes"><sup>1</sup></a> Several white sites have been successfully sold, including those which are now the Novena Medical Centre cum retail mall, and The Sail at Marina Bay.</p>
<p>In residential areas, childcare centres within landed housing estates, while providing a greater choice of locations for parents and childcare operators, could create nuisance for neighbours. URA carried out public consultations on the guidelines for childcare centres within landed areas to find a balanced solution that addressed both the concerns of residents regarding noise and traffic, and the needs of parents and childcare operators.</p>
<p>A balance also has to be found between flexibility for businesses and longer term sustainability. For example, while guidelines for industrial developments were relaxed to allow some e-businesses and selected media activities to be carried out within industrial premises, the requirement of a minimum 60% of industrial activities remains in place. This is to ensure that the stock of industrial space needed to support Singapore's manufacturing sector is not eroded through conversion to other uses, which could also inadvertently drive up industrial land prices.</p>



</div>

<h3>PLANNING FOR SUCCESS</h3>

<p>Planning in Singapore is about making the most effective use of limited land resources to create a distinctive, attractive and vibrant city, not only for now but also for future generations to enjoy. Long-term planning for all our various land needs provides the assurance that population and economic growth can be accommodated. This includes providing a choice of different housing types and locations, space to grow businesses, attractive and accessible recreational amenities, and a comprehensive and efficient road and rail system to meet transport needs. Planning also enables Singapore to retain its natural and built heritage, helping to create a world-class city which is not only attractive, but also distinctive and authentically Singaporean.</p>




<p class="small-text text">Land use planning in Singapore presents unique challenges. Singapore is a small city-state. In addition to catering for housing, business, social and recreational needs, activities which are typically located outside the city have to be accommodated within Singapore's limited land area. These include international ports and airports, and major utilities such as water treatment plants and power stations. Land also has to be set aside for water catchment and storage, as well as for security needs, such as military training areas and bases.</p>

<h3 class="title">LAND USE PLANNING IN SINGAPORE:<br>
PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS</h3>
<h3>SMALL ISLAND, BIG NEEDS</h3>
<p>Land use planning in Singapore presents unique challenges. Singapore is a small city-state. In addition to catering for housing, business, social and recreational needs, activities which are typically located outside the city have to be accommodated within Singapore's limited land area. These include international ports and airports, and major utilities such as water treatment plants and power stations. Land also has to be set aside for water catchment and storage, as well as for security needs, such as military training areas and bases.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are constraints to the free development of an already limited stock of land. Building height is limited by the flight paths of planes. There are also restrictions on locating pollutive uses of land, such as industries, which have to be restricted within water catchment areas to protect the quality of the water supply. Other major utilities such as power stations and incineration plants impose health, safety and nuisance buffers, which limit the activities and developments that can be permitted near them.</p>
<p>Singapore's finite land resource means trade-offs inevitably have to be made between different uses. For example, providing more land for industrial developments may require housing to be more densely built, while the retention of natural areas may reduce land available for development.</p>
<p>The key challenge is therefore to consider the various land use demands comprehensively so that potential trade-offs between uses can be evaluated holistically in order to meet two primary objectives: catering for growth, and providing a good living environment. Should we set aside more land for industries to support economic growth? Should we plan for more landed and low-density housing areas, or should we keep more nature areas, parks and open spaces, as well as heritage areas which could otherwise be redeveloped? How can we decide what is more important for the country? What does the public value?</p>
<h3>STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS</h3>
<h4>Residential Land Use</h4>
<p>Singapore's strategy for residential areas is to increase densities for new housing, particularly in the city area, in order to minimise land required. At the same time, landed and low-density housing areas are retained to create variety and offer options in Singapore's residential environment, in order to meet the housing aspirations of Singaporeans. The challenge is to create equally attractive high-density housing areas. This can be achieved by providing good amenities and transport facilities to make living in high-density areas more convenient. Greenery and good urban design can also make dense residential areas more attractive. Public feedback has also shown that people are generally prepared to live in high-rise apartments with higher floors, if privacy is maintained through good design and layout.</p>
	
	
<h5>
Singapore's challenge is to find a balance between optimising industrial land use and retaining its competitive edge as a manufacturing location.
</h5>

	
<h4>Industrial Land Use</h4>
	
<p>Given that manufacturing is expected to remain a significant contributor to the economy, land is needed to support the growth of the industrial sector. This includes high value-added sectors, such as petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, which typically require large tracts of land due to the nature of their production processes and plant layouts. Without further intensification of land use in land-scarce Singapore, it may be difficult to continue to sustain the growth of the industrial sector in the longer term. However, companies are often reluctant to redesign their processes or intensify their development, as this could introduce production risks. Requiring them to do so could make Singapore less competitive.</p>
	
<p>Some design innovations, such as JTC's stacked-up factories,<a href="#notes"><sup>2</sup></a> which have ramps which allow container trucks to make doorstep deliveries to higher floors, are geared towards more efficient use of industrial land.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, higher-intensity industrial developments have yet to gain widespread acceptance from industrialists. Singapore's planning challenge is therefore to find a balance between optimising industrial land use to ensure that future needs can be met, and retaining its competitive edge as a manufacturing location today.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Tampines Regional Centre" src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_02/TRC.png"></p>
<p><em>Tampines Regional Centre</em></p>
	
<h4>Commercial Centres</h4>
<p>The growth of the Central Business District into the reclaimed land at Marina Bay was planned over 30 years ago and is now being realised. Tampines Regional Centre, the first of the regional centres proposed in the 1991 Concept Plan to be developed, was built up through the sale of over 10 land parcels in the span of about a decade. Tampines today is an established hub for the back offices of many financial institutions, and a retail and entertainment hub serving the needs of residents in the eastern part of Singapore. In the next few years, the focus outside the city centre will be to build up Jurong Regional Centre into a business and transportation hub and to develop Paya Lebar into another commercial hub to meet the demand for business space. Detailed plans for these new commercial centres will be released in 2008 as part of the review of the Master Plan.</p>
<h4>Transportation</h4>
<p>Land use planning plays an important role in improving accessibility to goods and services and reducing the need to travel. For instance, the majority of commercial activities is planned to be located within the city centre to create a critical mass of activities and help position Singapore as a global business hub. To allow people to live close to this concentration of employment opportunities, more housing is being introduced into and near the city centre. Outside the city, more employment areas are planned near suburban residential areas; for example, industrial estates are situated at the fringe of housing estates and more commercial hubs such as Tampines Regional Centre and Novena fringe centre. This helps reduce commuting and lessen transport demand.</p>
<p>The rail network will be expanded to at least double the current network in the long term. Radial lines will provide direct links to the city centre, while orbital lines will serve those travelling from one place to another outside the city centre. This will enhance accessibility and reduce travel times, making public transport more attractive and reducing reliance on private transport.</p>
<p>With less reliance on private transport, the need for more roads and road-widening which may affect surrounding land uses will be reduced, and environmental quality will be better maintained as noise and air pollution will also be reduced. Higher-density developments can be sited at locations well-served by rail transit stations, providing convenient access without creating excessive congestion.</p>
<h4>Recreational Land Use</h4>
<p>As Singapore becomes more built up, the presence of greenery and open spaces will become even more important as a relief to high-density living. While parks and open spaces take up a significant amount of land, their availability is highly valued by the public for recreation and relaxation. Hence, even though demand for land will increase with a bigger population,<a href="#notes"><sup>3</sup></a> more land will be set aside for parks and open spaces.</p>
<p>The introduction of park connectors creates "green corridors" linking parks with town centres, sports complexes and homes. This expands recreation space and increases accessibility to parks and the coastline, with minimal opportunity cost, since park connectors generally run along drainage reserves, road reserves or under viaducts. Today, the total length of park connectors in Singapore is 70 kilometres; the aim is to increase this total length to 200 kilometres by 2012, and to more than 400 kilometres in the long term. Water bodies will also be integrated with parks and green spaces to create new opportunities for water-based recreational and leisure activities. Promoting sky-gardens and high-rise greenery will also help to create a sense of pervasive lush greenery even in built-up areas.</p>
<h4>Land Optimisation</h4>
<p>To help manage land demand, several innovative land optimisation strategies have been adopted, such as building more intensively, making better use of underground space or co-locating uses. Singapore's long-term planning approach ensures that even as land is set aside for economic activities, there is sufficient provision of land for a variety of housing types, parks and open space for recreation, and community facilities without maximising the use of every land parcel to the detriment of the overall quality of the environment. Some areas, not needed to be developed yet, are put to interim short-term uses, for example, agriculture in Lim Chu Kang and cultural/arts activities in the old Tanglin Camp.</p>
<p>Even in the area of infrastructure planning, land optimisation measures are in place. The Deep Tunnel Sewerage System, currently under construction, will link two centralised water reclamation plants; once the system is in use, many existing water reclamation plants and pumping stations located all over the island can be phased out eventually and the land put to other uses.</p>
<h4>Creating a Distinctive, Attractive City</h4>
<p>An important planning principle in Singapore is to create a city which is attractive, vibrant, liveable, and distinctive. One of the tools to achieve this is good urban design, which can generate quality environments and distinctive identities. For instance, urban design guidelines require new developments fronting the Singapore River to be no more than four storeys high at the front and up to 10 storeys high at the back. This maintains a comfortable human scale along the promenade defined by the low-rise conserved shophouses and warehouses along the river. Pitched roofs are required to complement the distinctive historic character of the area. To create an exciting cityscape, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) also actively promotes architecture and urban design excellence to create an awareness and appreciation for good design and to encourage greater creativity in design.</p>
<p>Another strategy is to capitalise on assets such as Singapore's islandness — for example, with waterfront housing, coastal parks and waterfront recreational opportunities. A further measure towards creating an attractive environment is through greening and conserving our natural heritage where possible. Beyond the protected nature reserves, nature areas are retained and integrated within parks and other developments where feasible. For example, as a result of government-facilitated consultations between a golf course developer and the Nature Society, core areas with rich flora and fauna were preserved at Kranji, and the re-creation of natural habitats allowed birds, including some endangered local species, to continue to roost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Conservation" src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_02/Conservation.png"></p>
	
	
<p><em>The "old-and-new" approach allows for shophouses to be conserved between new infill development.</em></p>
<h4>Conservation</h4>
<p>The preservation and restoration of historic areas is an important element in Singapore's distinctive cityscape, and there is now widespread public support and interest in conservation. As more of our city becomes developed and redeveloped to cater to the needs of a larger population, the retention of our identity through conservation will become more important.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to strike a balance between retaining historic streetscapes for the public and intensifying the use of land through redevelopment. Innovative strategies like the "old-and-new" approach allow for shophouses to be conserved between new infill developments, such as China Square. In the conservation of buildings in the Syed Alwi area, while critical buildings which contributed to the identity and character of the street were retained, others were excluded to minimise the loss of development potential and restrictions in redevelopment.</p>
