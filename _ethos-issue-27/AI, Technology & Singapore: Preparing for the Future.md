<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
    The rapid adoption of generative AI (GenAI) applications could mark a new and unprecedented inflection point in technological advancement and impact. The factors that drove the rise of the digital age have intensified: growth and access to compute power; rapid innovation amplified by global connectivity; the convergence of technologies, and a democratisation of access and adoption due to falling costs, increased connectivity and cloud computing. Governments are responding strongly to this new opportunity to reap strategic and economic advantage with ambitious national AI plans and even passing legislation to control access to technology. But it is unclear if these approaches can fully safeguard against real threats of AI-accelerated job displacement, heightened inequality, or an increasingly untrustworthy information ecosystem. With global powers exerting influence on technology supply chains, including on components critical to AI-powered innovation such as advanced chip manufacturing and supply, small states like Singapore stand particularly vulnerable in this new wave of technological change. This article dives deeper into three driving forces of tech-enabled disruption, with pervasive AI as an accelerant: economic transformation, info ecosystem complexity, and Great-Power competition. We then lay out three scenarios of a future Singapore where these driving forces have played out, posing initial questions about what appropriate policy responses might be if these were to be realised.
</p>

<h2>Small states like Singapore stand particularly vulnerable in this new wave of technological change</h2>

<h3>Driving Force 1: Jobs and the Economy, Transformed</h3>
<p>
    New business models, changing worker aspirations and growing connectivity across information, capital and people flows have reshaped the economy and the nature of work. Some of these changes happened slowly; others were accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as remote work became an overnight norm. The pandemic rendered entire sectors unviable. Unlike previous major disruptions such as the Asian Financial Crisis, the dotcom bust and the Global Financial Crisis, unemployment occurred across sectors, prompting governments to offer broad-based relief measures, including support for the self-employed. That the economic downturn sparked by the pandemic was amplified by AI-related disruptions surprised many. Big tech companies announced layoffs and hiring pauses in moves directly attributed to AI. Enterprise solution providers like Microsoft and Salesforce started pushing out AI-driven productivity solutions to reduce manpower needs at workplaces.
</p>
<p>
    Experts predict that upcoming waves of displacement will be felt more deeply in advanced economies compared to emerging markets; white-collar work is more at risk than manual labour, and effects will be felt across sectors.
</p>
<p>
    Recognising the harmful impacts of swift job displacement, Bill Gates once advocated taxing robot-using companies to slow automation and to finance human-centric jobs.
</p>
<p>
    Singapore has not been immune to such dynamics. While technology-driven displacement is not new, its upcoming speed and scale could render our safety nets and policies no longer fit for purpose, outpacing our current provisions for upskilling, job matching and social support. New vulnerable groups could emerge (e.g., high-income white-collar workers). Disruptions would affect jobs across sectors, complicating attempts to target job and skill interventions.
</p>

<h3>Driving Force 2: A More Complex Information Ecosystem</h3>
<p>
    Fake news at scale has had far-reaching implications. Even as states struggle to hold media platforms accountable to standards and rules, the risk of GenAI supercharging customised mis/disinformation looms large. In cybersecurity, malign actors may use GenAI to mount security attacks with increased sophistication at scale. New forms of crime—AI-assisted deepfake scams, extortion schemes, identity theft and harassment—are already emerging.
</p>
<p>
    We may soon operate in an information ecosystem where most information is false or contains falsehood. Bad actors in this ecosystem can operate at scale, leading to a significant loss of trust in transacting online. What do we need to do to ensure timely and accurate dissemination of important information? What new harms may emerge from GenAI and how should we protect people from them?
</p>

<h3>Driving Force 3: Superpowers in Motion</h3>
<p>
    In the past decade, countries at the forefront of technological development or those controlling critical supply chains have been exerting greater international influence and leverage, accelerating economic competition and widening inequality between states. International cooperation has become ever more vital on many levels, from standards-setting to cybersecurity and regulating emerging technologies that often transcend national borders. At the same time, the digital domain remains a battlefield, from information and psychological warfare to state-sponsored hacking: now augmented by AI.
</p>
<p>
    This is particularly worrying for Singapore as a small player. The geopolitical playing field in the digital domain often maps onto global military might, yet players such as the Lazarus Group of hackers show that there is power in pure digital sophistication. Non-state actors that dominate the digital realm add complexity as they are less bound to international laws and norms.
</p>
<p>
    With security concerns at the core, global powers have strongly exerted economic influence on each other in the technology domain. The US effort to contain China’s growth will continue, as international moves to decouple supply chains accelerates. The world recognises the risk of concentrating advanced chip manufacturing in Taiwan’s TSMC; the US CHIPS Act and other moves to contain China have been met without much international protest, with some US allies like Japan and the Netherlands announcing their own export controls. Singapore may have to compromise on its geopolitical wiggle room to maintain access to technology and capabilities.
</p>

<h2>Three Scenarios for Singapore Tomorrow</h2>
<p>
    The following three future scenarios illustrate the interplay of these driving forces and their inherent uncertainties as they could unfold in Singapore. They are meant to surface policy implications and questions that are less discussed, particularly in the social domain.
</p>
<p>
    Our current approaches to unemployment, income security, and social support may not be resilient against mass, protracted job displacement. A broad, educated middle, made newly vulnerable, could present unique challenges. The ongoing technology war could impact our access to capabilities, markets, and even present social implications in our multicultural context.
</p>
<p>
    We hope these scenarios will prompt deeper discussion of the underlying driving forces at work, in order to better prepare for rapid tech-driven disruptions to our lives.
