<p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is only the latest frontier in a suite of new technologies that will profoundly reshape the nature of work, citizen engagement and service delivery. These are early days: most public and private sector organisations globally are still planning and experimenting with ways to deploy it meaningfully. What is already abundantly clear is that GenAI is shaping up to be a catalyst for ground-breaking change across economies, markets, societies, and governments. It will significantly impact the nature of work across all industries, either through automation or augmentation.


</p><h3>BRACE FOR POSITIVE IMPACT</h3>

	
<p>Accenture’s research across 22 countries and 19 industries suggests that the public sector will see 42% of its working hours impacted by GenAI.<sup><a href="#notestop">1</a></sup> There is much room for optimism that this impact will benefit the public sector in diverse ways, from reinventing organisational processes and redesigning workflows, to altering workforce dynamics and influencing regulatory environments.</p>
	
	

<p>For one, GenAI can be used to tap the full potential of data, to better illuminate citizens’ needs and assess policy outcomes. Co-pilots trained on Large Language Models (LLMs) can also automate data retrieval, helping civil servants draw more efficiently from rich troves of data across multiple channels to prepare reports in significantly less time.</p>


<p>These AI tools can also optimise language-based work processes, such as by automating chatbot reminders and case progress updates to clients.</p>


<div class="containerbox">

<p class="header1">A TASTE OF THINGS TO COME</p>
	

<p>We are now in the era of “co-pilots”—software that uses AI to augment and enhance individuals’ daily tasks, both at work and at home. </p>
	
	
	
<p>Chatbots could also provide personalised answers to citizens’ questions regarding government policies within seconds. Speech-to text software could swiftly transcribe case notes for social workers, enabling them to focus on high-quality interactions with clients.

</p><p>These generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools are just a foretaste of the transformative impact that the public service could deliver to citizens by harnessing this latest evolution in AI technologies.</p>

</div>



<h3>OFF TO A PROMISING START</h3>

<p>The Singapore Public Service is no stranger to leveraging artificial intelligence to make services more efficient, seamless, and integrated for citizens, through initiatives such as the Digital Government Blueprint and the National AI Strategy. It is this long-running strategic focus on harnessing advanced technologies to transform the public and private sectors that have won Singapore the top spot in Asia’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) readiness rankings.<sup><a href="#notestop">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Agencies like GovTech are already reaping results from AI pilots. Its One Service Chatbot automates the extraction of case details, predicts the category of cases, and then routes them to relevant agencies—saving about 2,000 man-hours since it began operations in 2021.</p>

<p>There is potential to further enhance the One Service Chatbot with functions already possible with ChatGPT 4, so it might evaluate both text and photos to address citizens’ concerns. For instance, users could submit a picture of a cluttered HDB corridor, and the Chatbot could then automatically generate a case for resolving this fire hazard.</p>

<p>Soon we might also see government agencies harness AI-powered translation and voice generation—for instance, to boost the diversity and reach of public service education videos for Singapore’s multilingual population.</p>

<p>These are just some examples of the immediate benefits that the public sector might reap from GenAI approaches. But for GenAIs to serve as valuable co-pilots, their LLM models must be enhanced with agency-specific datasets, employing techniques like fine-tuning and instruction-led tuning. LLMs are a type of foundation model, designed to understand, generate and interact with human language. Such models need vast amounts of curated sample data to learn effectively.</p>

</div>


<p>This scale of data requires a modern enterprise platform to host a trusted, reusable set of data products. Such enterprise-wide platforms liberate data from organisational silos by securely housing the data, along with enterprise-grade analytics and AI tools, in cloud-based warehouses. These data warehouses can be made easily accessible for use across organisations or through different federated computing techniques, such as a data mesh.</p>

<div class="break">
<p class="break1">What the public service needs is a workforce equipped with the Technology Quotient (TQ) to drive GenAI at scale.
</p>
</div>

<p>As the Singapore Public Service develops a robust core digital and cloud-based infrastructure of its own and becomes more data-mature, it will be able to push the boundaries of what AI co-pilots can achieve. For example, it could employ active learning techniques to train co-pilots on agency-relevant data in real-time for accurate, timely decisions at scale.</p>

<p>The true value of foundation models becomes evident when these models are contextualised to provide accurate and nuanced answers to user queries. Contextualisation may involve fine-tuning the foundation model on organisational data or using a more scalable approach like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG enables the GenAI system to "search" against institutional data and embed this into the system's results, offering richer and more contextualised outcomes.</p>

<p>For instance, a RAG-enabled LLM for public housing in Singapore might provide specific and tailored answers to home buyers navigating the range of housing grants and policies. Similarly, businesses could find it easier to interact with a chatbot using a RAG-enabled LLM for taxation policy, which may otherwise be technically challenging for the typical business owner to comprehend.</p>
