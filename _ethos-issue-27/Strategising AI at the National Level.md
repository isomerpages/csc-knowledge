<h3>Introduction</h3>	
	
<p>The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has prompted a growing number of countries vying to become de facto leaders in this emerging technology. In Asia, China has signalled its ambition to become ‘the world leader in AI’ by 2030,<sup><a href="#notestop">1</a></sup>  while the United Arab Emirates seeks to establish itself as an ‘AI destination’ by 2031.<sup><a href="#notestop">2</a></sup> In Europe, Germany has ambitions for ‘AI made in Germany’ to be a mark of quality,<sup><a href="#notestop">3</a></sup> while the Nordic countries are striving to lead in the field of AI ethics.<sup><a href="#notestop">4</a></sup> Singapore's concerted investment in human capital, digital infrastructure, innovation, and AI governance has positioned it at the top of the IMF’s ‘AI Preparedness Index’.<sup><a href="#notestop">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Desire to participate in the AI revolution is not limited to high-income countries. Lower and middle-income countries are increasingly looking to bridge the digital divide and reap the benefits that AI promises. To date, more than 60 countries have launched their respective national AI strategies, with over 1,000 AI policy initiatives being curated by the OECD.<sup><a href="#notestop">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Policymakers are coming to grips with AI’s revolutionary possibilities—from its versatility as a general-purpose technology to its potential to disrupt existing norms and forge new ‘operational logics’ guiding our societies. The challenge is to reimagine the state by steering AI development and adoption along multiple, concurrent dimensions vital to both present and future governance contexts: </p>

<li>In the <b>socio-economic landscape</b>, AI will drive productivity and faster critical innovations in the fields of education, healthcare and public services. At the same time, there are concerns that such change will come at the cost of increased job insecurity for some, as well as a growing digital divide</li>

  

<li>AI's <b>socio-political Impact</b> will be felt most keenly through its ability to transform decision-making processes across all levels of society. Here are two areas of critical concern: the integrity and security of our information systems and the biases inherent in AI-driven decisions.</li>

  

<li>Approcaches to <b>governance and regulation</b> will need to be multidisciplinary, to balance the vast potential of AI for public good with its inherent risks.</li>

</ol>

<h3>AI's Socio-Economic Dimension</h3>	

<p>National AI strategies and policies commonly outline how countries plan to invest in AI to <b>leverage their comparative advantages</b>, with some prioritising industry applications, such as in logistics and transportation, energy, health, and agriculture.<sup><a href="#notestop">7</a></sup></p> 

<p>Alongside vertical investments, there is also growing recognition of AI as a key horizontal enabler of productivity and competitiveness. For instance, comparing Singapore’s first National AI Strategy in 2019 with its second iteration in 2023 reveals a marked shift, from approaching AI with a specialist sectoral focus to viewing it as a broader enabler to be deployed across all sectors.<sup><a href="#notestop">8</a></sup> Increasingly, AI strategies, alongside that of digital and data strategies, are underpinning the new industrial approaches of the 21st century.<sup><a href="#notestop">9</a></sup></p>

<p>Across the globe, AI is fostering new forms of economic activity, reshaping the labour market, and redefining market competition. Whilst this is promising for innovation and productivity, it also raises <b>concerns regarding job displacements and worsening economic inequality</b> as evidenced by previous waves of technological transformations.<sup><a href="#notestop">10</a></sup></p>


<p>Nevertheless, AI also has the potential to boost the productivity of lower-skilled, lower-expertise workers. A study of customer-support agents found that when call-centre operators used generative AI assistants in their work, they became 14 per cent more productive. There was also a 34 per cent increase in productivity for the lowest-skilled agents, who moved up the learning curve faster with generative AI assistance.<sup><a href="#notestop">11</a></sup>  While insights from these recent studies have yet to make their way into formal strategies, countries like Singapore are already adopting and scaling AI across the public sector to assist with writing, research, coding and transcription tasks.<sup><a href="#notestop">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="#notestop">13</a></sup> </p> 

Many national AI strategies are placing a strong emphasis on empowering individuals through re-training and up-skilling programmes, ensuring that those affected by AI transitions can pivot to new roles. Governments must act swiftly to harness the potential of AI as a social-levelling tool to narrow the digital divide,<sup><a href="#notestop">14</a></sup> such as by improving access to personalised learning, making high-quality educational experiences accessible to people in remote or underserved areas, breaking down language barriers by harnessing multilingual capabilities,<sup><a href="#notestop">15</a></sup> identifying and clarifying workforce gaps and skills needs,<sup><a href="#notestop">16</a></sup> and improving pathways to upskilling.

<p>Alongside the use of AI to enable socio-economic development, there is also a growing interest in using AI to tackle <b>societal, developmental, and environmental challenges.</b> The innovative use of AI promises to help advance Sustainable Development Goals:17 from using cognitive digital technologies to improve diagnostic capabilities in health, to improving financial inclusion for women, to enhancing disaster response with more accurate forecasting and real-time date analysis, among many other applications.</p>
	
<p>The adoption of <b>AI in the public sector</b> to improve service delivery for citizens, deliver greater public value and promote societal inclusion is high on the agenda of some governments. For example: </p>


<ul>
	
<li>Singapore’s National AI Strategy 2.0 (2023) aims to improve public service productivity with new value propositions for citizens_</li>	

	
<li>Canada’s AI Strategy (2017) ambition is to advance equity, diversity and inclusion in the Canadian AI ecosystem and globally, and to ensure that AI is developed and deployed to the benefit of all citizens of the world</li>	
	

<li>South Korea’s AI Strategy (2019) seeks to improve happiness of people and quality of life, and to respond proactively to social changes including job markets</li>	
	
<li>The United Kingdom’s National AI Strategy (2021) wants to ensure that AI benefits all sectors and regions, and to establish the public sector as an exemplar for AI procurement and ethics, in order to deliver greater public value for money
	
</li></ul>	

<p>Nevertheless, AI use has yet to become mainstream in many governments. A good  first step would be to equip civil servants with the right tools and environment for responsible experimentation, to help build institutional knowledge and practical understanding to better inform AI governance. Consider the example of ChatGPT: in its early days, countries like Italy banned it outright; schools in several countries prohibited its use. But the city of Boston chose to embrace it instead. They issued guidelines encouraging staff to experiment with generative AI to understand its potential, emphasising privacy, security, and public purpose. By shifting the focus from just governing the technology to using the technology for governance, Boston eventually reduced the initial alarmism and highlighted AI’s potential for social good. <a href="#notestop"><sup>18</sup></a></p>


<h3>AI's Socio-Political Dimension</h3>

<p>AI is reshaping decision-making processes across different verticals in society and is thus increasingly becoming a focal point for political and security considerations. Two main concerns arise from this: the first is to do with <b>integrity of the information ecosystem,</b> and the second involves <b>biases that accompany AI-enabled decision-making.</b></p>
