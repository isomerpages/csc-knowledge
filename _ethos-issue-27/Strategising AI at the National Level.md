<h3>Introduction</h3>	
	
The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has prompted a growing number of countries vying to become de facto leaders in this emerging technology. In Asia, China has signalled its ambition to become ‘the world leader in AI’ by 2030,1  while the United Arab Emirates seeks to establish itself as an ‘AI destination’ by 2031.2 In Europe, Germany has ambitions for ‘AI made in Germany’ to be a mark of quality,3 while the Nordic countries are striving to lead in the field of AI ethics.4 Singapore's concerted investment in human capital, digital infrastructure, innovation, and AI governance has positioned it at the top of the IMF’s ‘AI Preparedness Index’.5

Desire to participate in the AI revolution is not limited to high-income countries. Lower and middle-income countries are increasingly looking to bridge the digital divide and reap the benefits that AI promises. To date, more than 60 countries have launched their respective national AI strategies, with over 1,000 AI policy initiatives being curated by the OECD.6 

Policymakers are coming to grips with AI’s revolutionary possibilities—from its versatility as a general-purpose technology to its potential to disrupt existing norms and forge new ‘operational logics’ guiding our societies. The challenge is to reimagine the state by steering AI development and adoption along multiple, concurrent dimensions vital to both present and future governance contexts:

<li>In the <b>socio-economic landscape</b>, AI will drive productivity and faster critical innovations in the fields of education, healthcare and public services. At the same time, there are concerns that such change will come at the cost of increased job insecurity for some, as well as a growing digital divide</li>

  

<li>AI's <b>socio-political Impact</b> will be felt most keenly through its ability to transform decision-making processes across all levels of society. Here are two areas of critical concern: the integrity and security of our information systems and the biases inherent in AI-driven decisions.</li>

  

<li>Approcaches to <b>governance and regulation</b> will need to be multidisciplinary, to balance the vast potential of AI for public good with its inherent risks.</li>
