<h3>Introduction</h3>

	
<p> The rapid adoption of generative AI (GenAI) applications could mark a new and unprecedented inflection point in technological advancement and impact. The factors that drove the rise of the digital age have intensified: growth and access to compute power; rapid innovation amplified by global connectivity; the convergence of technologies, and a democratisation of access and adoption due to falling costs, increased connectivity and cloud computing. Governments are responding strongly to this new opportunity to reap strategic and economic advantage with ambitious national AI plans and even passing legislation to control access to technology. But it is unclear if these approaches can fully safeguard against real threats of AI-accelerated job displacement, heightened inequality, or an increasingly untrustworthy information ecosystem. With global powers exerting influence on technology supply chains, including on components critical to AI-powered innovation such as advanced chip manufacturing and supply, small states like Singapore stand particularly vulnerable in this new wave of technological change. This article dives deeper into three driving forces of tech-enabled disruption, with pervasive AI as an accelerant: economic transformation, info ecosystem complexity, and Great- Power competition. We then lay out three scenarios of a future Singapore where these driving forces have played out, posing initial questions about what appropriate policy responses might be if these were to be realised.</p>


<div class="break">
<p class="break1">Small states like Singapore stand particularly vulnerable in this new wave of technological change</p>

</div>		




<h3>Driving Force 1: Jobs and the Economy, Transformed</h3>

<p>New business models, changing worker aspirations and growing connectivity across information, capital and people flows have reshaped the economy and the nature of work. Some of these changes happened slowly; others were accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as remote work became an overnight norm. The pandemic rendered entire sectors unviable. Unlike previous major disruptions such as the Asian Financial Crisis, the dotcom bust and the Global Financial Crisis, <b>unemployment occurred across sectors</b>,<sup><a href="#notestop">1</a></sup> prompting governments to offer broad-based relief measures, including support for the self-employed. That the economic downturn sparked by the pandemic was amplified by AI- related disruptions surprised many. Big tech companies announced layoffs and hiring pauses in moves directly attributed to AI. Enterprise solution providers like Microsoft and Salesforce started pushing out AI- driven productivity solutions to reduce manpower needs at workplaces.</p>


<p>That the economic downturn sparked by the pandemic was amplified by AI-related disruptions surprised many. Big tech companies announced layoffs and hiring pauses in moves directly attributed to AI. Enterprise solution providers like Microsoft and Salesforce started pushing out AI-driven productivity solutions to reduce manpower needs at workplaces. Experts predict that <b>upcoming waves of displacement will be felt more deeply in advanced economies compared to emerging markets; white-collar work is more at risk than manual labour, and effects will be felt across sectors.</b><sup><a href="#notestop">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Recognising the harmful impacts of swift job displacement, Bill Gates once advocated taxing robot-using companies to slow automation and to finance human-centric jobs.</p>

<p>Singapore has not been immune to such dynamics. While technology-driven displacement is not new, <b>its upcoming speed and scale could render our safety nets and policies no longer fit for purpose</b>, outpacing our current provisions for upskilling, job matching and social support. <b>New vulnerable groups could emerge</b> (e.g. high-income white-collar workers). <b>Disruptions would affect jobs across sectors, complicating attempts to target job and skill interventions.</b></p>


<h3>Driving Force 2: A More Complex Information Ecosystem</h3>

<p>Fake news at scale has had far-reaching implications. Even as states struggle to hold media platforms accountable to standards and rules, the risk of GenAI supercharging customised mis/disinformation looms large. In cybersecurity, malign actors may use GenAI to mount security attacks with increased sophistication at scale. New forms of crime—AI-assisted deepfake scams, extortion schemes, identity theft and harassment—are already emerging.</p>

<p>We may soon operate in <b>an information ecosystem where most information is false or contains falsehood. Bad actors in this ecosystem can operate at scale, leading to a significant loss of trust in transacting online.</b> What do we need to do to ensure timely and accurate dissemination of important information? What new harms may emerge from GenAI and how should we protect people from them?</p>


<h3>Driving Force 3: Superpowers in Motion</h3>

<p>In the past decade, countries at the forefront of technological development or those controlling critical supply chains have been exerting greater international influence and leverage, accelerating economic competition and widening inequality between states. International cooperation has become ever more vital on many levels, from standards-setting to cybersecurity and regulating emerging technologies that often transcend national borders. At the same time, the digital domain remains a battlefield, from information and psychological warfare to state-sponsored hacking: now augmented by AI.</p>

<p>This is particularly worrying for Singapore as a small player. The geopolitical playing field in the digital domain often maps onto global military might, yet players such as the Lazarus Group of hackers show that there is power in pure digital sophistication. Non-state actors that dominate the digital realm add complexity as they are less bound to international laws and norms.</p>

<p><b>With security concerns at the core, global powers have strongly exerted economic influence on each other in the technology domain.</b> The US effort to contain China’s growth will continue, as international moves to decouple supply chains accelerates. The world recognises the risk of concentrating advanced chip manufacturing in Taiwan’s TSMC; the US CHIPS Act and other moves to contain China have been met without much international protest, with some US allies like Japan and the Netherlands announcing their own export controls. <b>Singapore may have to compromise on its geopolitical wiggle room to maintain access to technology and capabilities.</b></p>

<h3>Three Scenarios for Singapore Tomorrow</h3>

<p>The following three future scenarios illustrate the interplay of these driving forces and their inherent uncertainties as they could unfold in Singapore. They are meant to surface policy implications and questions that are less discussed, particularly in the social domain.</p>

<p>Our current approaches to unemployment, income security, and social support may not be resilient against mass, protracted job displacement. A broad, educated middle, made newly vulnerable, could present unique challenges. The ongoing technology war could impact our access to capabilities, markets, and even present social implications in our multicultural context.</p>

<p>We hope these scenarios will prompt deeper discussion of the underlying driving forces at work, in order to better prepare for rapid tech-driven disruptions to our lives.</p>





<div class="containerbox">

<span class="scenario">SCENARIO 1</span>
<p class="title">People Interrupted</p>
	
	
<img src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_27/Ai__Technology_and_Singapore1.png">	


<p>2024 is the year things really start to change. One by one, states embark on ambitious AI strategies, Singapore among them. But the world moves faster than these strategies anticipate.
<br><span class="sub">Internationally, Singapore is seen as a beacon of AI ambition.</span>	
</p>

<p>By 2025, knowledge workers across domains have been significantly displaced due to AI augmentation. Professionals from lawyers and brokers to management consultants face pay-cuts or layoffs. “Job redesign” becomes shorthand for being paid less to do less because of GenAI. Parents move their children to cheaper preschools, and new homeowners appeal for mortgage relief. Lower middle-income groups mock the newly displaced as complaining about “first world problems”. Consumer spending plummets. <br>
<span class="sub">A new vulnerable group emerges: upper middle-class professionals </span><br> 
<span class="sub">“Job redesign” means being paid less to do less</span></p>

<p>The Treasury finds it difficult to scope relief because employers are not fully transparent about job downsizing, and practices across the private sector are uneven. In the creative industry, well-established players become even more sought after while average creative workers compete with free GenAI output. Creatives regret never organising, like the American Writers Guild did in 2023. Some suggest providing universal support, but the system is internally conflicted about this move. <br><span class="sub">New job “winners” emerge, often with no skills to do with AI; winner-takes-all dynamics play out across industries</span> </p>

<p>Skills development agencies ramp up upskilling opportunities, introducing more subsidies and facilitating job-matching. But those that can afford to upskill find it difficult to enrol in the limited courses available, and many courses cannot keep up with the breakneck speed of AI innovation. Skills in new growth areas like AI, cybersecurity and data science are so specialised and require such deep knowledge and rapid upskilling that the majority cannot keep up. <br><span class="sub">Reskilling becomes more niche, but also too slow.</span></p>
	
<p> Some groups thrive. Employers value people who can understand and manipulate AI tools while managing human stakeholders. Surprisingly such people include graduates from all fields: STEM disciplines, the humanities, communications and the liberal arts. Educators attribute it to critical thinking, inter-personal skills, grit and creativity. The Education ministry embarks on a transformation effort. Independent schools with motivated teachers capitalise on GenAI tools to improve teaching and significantly enhance productivity. Healthcare experiences a boom in innovation, as do cyber-defence capabilities. <br><span class="sub"> 
Many thrive: innovators improving productivity in typically labour scarce sectors such as healthcare, critical thinkers and relationship-builders, are among the winners.</span></p>
	
	
<p>But the transformations in economy, skills and jobs come too slow for some. Many go without steady employment for months, even years. This group, with lofty aspirations and degrees, organise themselves politically; the opposition sees membership growth. Many of those displaced agitate for Universal Basic Income and Unemployment Insurance. Those with family abroad leave Singapore for good. Many struggle with competing caregiving demands, with both aged parents and young children. New forms of exploitation targeting the newly vulnerable emerge.<br><span class="sub"> People are exhausted from protracted financial precarity. Demands for new kinds of employment support emerge: unemployment insurance, universal basic income.</span></p>	
	
	
<p>Civil service and political leadership are divided: no policy solutions, however improved, manage to address the aspirational needs of the broad middle. Government is increasingly criticised as being out of touch, especially as the Public Service remains one of the few job-secure sectors. Trust in government hits an all-time low.<br><span class="sub">Trust in government falls, and there is growing disdain for public servants and political leadership.</span></p>		
	
	
<div class="policy">
	
<span>POLICY QUESTIONS</span>	
	
<ol type="a">
    <li>In the event of displacements or “job down-sizing,” how might employers be incentivised to cushion the negative impact on employees?</li>
    <li>Are our social safety nets resilient against prolonged job displacement, or mass job-downsizing, of white-collar workers?</li>
    <li>What traits and skills will help people thrive in such a future? How do we create the conditions for these traits to flourish among Singaporeans?</li>
    <li>As public servants continue to enjoy job security, how do we maintain the legitimacy of the public service if the general public faces a precarious employment outlook?</li>
</ol>
	
	
	
</div>	
	
	
</div>






























<h3>AI and Data: Twin Engines of Growth</h3>


<p>In recent years, traditional structure data sources have been supplemented with large and unstructured new data sources, such as social media data, online data, and data from smart devices. The proliferation of these data has enhanced the capabilities of AI and other technologies that thrive on information. In turn, these technologies have amplified the volume and variety of data—both structured and unstructured—by enabling the mass collection and analysis of information from diverse sources, further fuelling developments in AI. This has resulted in a self-reinforcing cycle of technological advancement and data expansion.</p>

<p>AI—a key component of this cycle—is adept at processing vast amounts of information, learning from data patterns, and performing complex tasks with increasing proficiency. This offers PublicService agencies numerous opportunities to enhance their operations and service delivery.</p>

<p>For instance, to enhance the efficiency of fieldwork operations, the Central Provident Fund Board’s Retirement Health Study Office developed a machine learning model to identify optimal time slots for interviewers to call on respondents without prior appointments.<sup><a href="#notestop">1</a></sup> In another example, the Housing Development Board collaborated with the Building and Construction Authority, Enterprise Singapore, and National Research Foundation to develop capabilities in drone façade inspection and visual analytics technologies, enabling safer and more efficient building inspections.<sup><a href="#notestop">2</a></sup>


</p><h3>Data Stewardship and Governance: A Cornerstone for Successful AI Adoption</h3>


<p> Successful adoption of AI involves more than just technological upgrades. Data quality, quantity and privacy are critical components of successful AI deployment. Each comes with its own challenges. Poor data quality can lead to subpar model performance, while insufficient data may lead to an under-representation of real world scenarios and skewed prediction outcomes. Inadequate governance and lack of privacy assurance undermine trust in data management, making people feel less confident in entrusting their data to organisations for AI learning. It is imperative to have a robust framework to address these challenges.</p>	
	
	
<div class="break">
<p class="break1">Data quality, quantity and privacy are critical components of successful AI deployment.</p>

</div>		
	

<p>As the National Statistical Office (NSO),DOS has extensive experience in the statistical domain, allowing it to establish a robust data governance framework<sup><a href="#notestop">3</a></sup> that comprehensively covers the entire data lifecycle (i.e., from planning, survey design, data collection, data processing, data analysis, and dissemination). This framework complies with Government-set guidelines, benchmarked against standards set by internationally recognised organisations and advanced NSOs, and is regularly updated to ensure its relevance. The framework thus serves as a good knowledge base for adopting key principles of responsible and ethicaln AI use, such as data confidentiality, model transparency and interpretability, and accountability.</p>


<p> Advocacy of statistical best practices and a track record of good data governance has ensured a high level of data quality produced within DOS and across the whole of government. This contributes to the building of a digital government through the Government Data Architecture initiative. In 2019, DOS was designated by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office as the Trusted Centre for Individual and Business Data to support the implementation of Singapore’s Government Data Strategy. DOS shares core individual and business administrative data within the government under the Public Sector (Governance) Act,<sup><a href="#notestop">4</a></sup> facilitating the use of data for policy analysis and service delivery.
	

</p><p>Through engagements with stakeholders such as the local Research and Statistics Units (RSUs), Single Source of Truths<sup><a href="#notestop">5</a></sup> which are custodians of core data, as well as other data producers in public agencies, a collaborative environment is fostered to uplift data stewardship practices and ensure that these are not just understood but actively applied. As data and AI practices are intertwined, the same engagement channels are used to identify and address common challenges. For instance, data privacy is a critical concern for government agencies due to the handling of vast amounts of sensitive information; DOS has thus engaged with agencies such asthe Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health to harness privacy-preserving technologies and other measures to safeguard data privacy.</p>

<h3>Continuous Upskilling: From Passive Learning to Active Practice</h3>
	
<p>To effectively leverage AI in the work of DOS officers, continuous upskilling is imperative, given the rapidly evolving technological landscape. Fortunately, statisticians’ traditional expertise in statistical theory and computer programming has already placed them in a good position to pick up advanced AI and Machine Learning (ML) skillsets.</p>	


<div class="break">
<p class="break1">DOS is nurturing a community of practice with an inclusive culture that empowers practitioners to align AI/ML initiatives with their personal interests.</p>
</div>		

<p>Tailored training workshops and an AI playbook help DOS officers stay up to date with the latest statistical and technological advancements as well as practical AI applications in the statistical and data analytical fields. Additionally, an in-house ML Toolkit supports DOS officers in their AI journey by making it easier for those with limited ML knowledge to build ML models from their data, as well as to appreciate key ethical considerations.</p>

<p>Apart from comprehensive training and tools, it is equally vital for staff to apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios. DOS is nurturing a community of practice with an inclusive culture that empowers practitioners to align AI/ML initiatives with their personal interests, thereby boosting their motivation and commitment to achieving successful outcomes. This strategy is similar to Public Service Division’s Gig Work Opportunities, where officers can apply to participate in posted projects that allow them to contribute their expertise and experience. For instance, the DOS Intelligent Classification Engine (DICE) project team was augmented with officers who were keen to leverage ML to streamline manual classification tasks. This strategy also ensures a variety of perspectives and experiences from diverse backgrounds, fostering innovation, creativity, and peer-to-peer learning.</p>


<p>DOS seconds selected officers to private companies with strong data science and AI/ML capabilities, allowing DOS to glean best practices and innovation from the private sector and benchmark itself against industry standards. Thematic sharing sessions on data science and analytics with other RSUs further enhance efficiency and encourage knowledge sharing across the statistical community. Such approaches can benefit all employees, not only those with technical expertise. Every officer has the opportunity to contribute valuable insights to enhance operations and productivity. Their comprehension of business processes and operational challenges aids in identifying areas where AI can make a substantial impact. Dedicated team channels facilitate these exchanges and encourage all to contribute to the conversations. This promotes a more inclusive learning environment where no officer feels left out from the rapid development of AI.</p>


<h3>Digital Transformation of Statistical Processes</h3>

<p>Due to budget and manpower constraints, coupled with the need to continue delivering core statistics, DOS has adopted a focused and agile approach to embedding AI/ML and automation technologies into business processes. DOS selects use cases strategically, based on key metrics such as the potential scale of impact, projected benefit, required effort, and the availability of related data.</p>


<p> In 2022, DOS established a Digital Transformation Unit (DTU) to work closely with various Divisions in DOS, serving as a coordinator to identify synergies between AI/ML projects. Operating under a hub-and-spoke model, DTU acts as the central hub, responsible for gathering, refining, and sharing AI use cases and knowhows, to minimise duplicative efforts. Meanwhile, the Divisions, or spokes, leverage their specialised expertise to apply AI/ML in ways that are most relevant to their specific areas of statistical work. The DTU also helps channel relevant talents to ensure that collaborative endeavours have the necessary expertise to kick-start the development of AI solutions and accelerate the time-to-market.</p>


<p>Over time, numerous internal solutions have been deployed to enhance statistical operations in DOS, covering tasks such as data collection, compilation, analysis, and distribution. For example, DOS is going beyond conventional business surveys for data collection by incorporating AI-extracted data from unstructured financial accounts. This reduces respondent burden and increases the scalability of data collection for more comprehensive data of businesses in the economy.</p>


<p>DOS has also used AI to find a novel way of updating the Statistical Business Register,<sup><a href="#notestop">6</a></sup> to improve the quality and efficiency of classification coding through the development of DICE, and to uncover statistical insights with Big Data.<sup><a href="#notestop">7</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition, DOS has participated in the Singapore Government’s AI Trailblazers programme,<sup><a href="#notestop">8</a></sup> which aims to accelerate the development of generative AI solutions that address real-world challenges for organisations. The programme enabled DOS to build and test their own generative AI solutions in a controlled and dedicated cloud-based environment, while identifying potential use cases.</p>


<p>None of these projects used AI for its own sake; the methods were employed only where they adhered to statistical concepts and were deemed most suitable in meeting user needs. Only after the value of an AI/ML method has been established through proof-of-concept experiments, and the model rigorously tested, will the solution be implemented organisation-wide at DOS or offered to the RSUs and the rest of the government.</p>


<div class="containerbox">

<span class="dice">DICE—Simplifying Standard Classification Coding</span>	

<p>The Singapore Standard Classification (SSXC) is used in the collection, compilation, and dissemination of national statistics. It facilitates data sharing and ensures consistency and comparability of data.</p>
	

<p>For instance, the Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) is used to classify firms according to their principal economic activity. Incorrect classification can adversely affect statistical compilation (e.g., GDP reporting), research studies (e.g., sectoral heterogeneity analysis), and policy implementation (e.g., level of support to promote a sector’s growth). However, users—whether business firms or public officers—might find it challenging to choose the most appropriate SSIC code from a range of possible codes without clear knowledge of their nuanced differences. Similarly, the Singapore Standard Occupational Classification (SSOC) is used to classify occupations; incorrect classifications can affect population censuses, household surveys, and administrative databases.</p>

<p>The DOS Intelligent Classification Engine (DICE) was developed to automatically identify the most relevant SSXC code through machine learning, thus improving consistency and reducing manual effort in the process. DICE processes textual inputs (e.g., a firm’s economic activity or a job’s title and description) and recommends suitable SSXC codes as an output, along with the engine’s confidence score.</p>

<span class="dices">HOW DICE WORKS</span>

<img src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_27/Supercharging_AI_with_Statistics_2.jpg">	
	
<p>DOS has used ML for coding SSOC/ SSIC since Census 2020.<sup><a href="#notestop">9</a></sup> The model has been continually improved through research and collaboration with RSUs, leading to the development of DICE today.</p>	
	

<p>DOS works closely with partner agencies, such as the Ministry of Manpower, Economic Development Board, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, as well as the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, to ensure that DICE’s performance and functionality meets their operational requirements.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>Moving forward, DICE is envisioned to be a comprehensive productivity tool for whole-of-government use, extending beyond industry and occupation codes to cover areas such as expenditure and commodities.</p>

<p class="break1">Successful AI adoption and digital transformation demand more than just technological advancements.</p>

</div>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Successful AI adoption and digital transformation demand more than just technological advancements. DOS has taken a multi-pronged approach to harnessing the full potential of AI and digital technologies. This includes instituting rigorous data management protocols, comprehensive security measures, and privacy safeguards to ensure the integrity and security of DOS’s data. In addition, DOS focuses on enhancing officers’ capabilities through curated training, as they are best positioned to grasp the business challenges and identify impactful ways for AI implementation. By strengthening internal and external engagements, as well as collaborating on digitalisation projects, DOS has enabled knowledge sharing on AI developments and fostered a culture of continuous improvement. These strategies have allowed DOS to harness AI productively, which in turn enhances DOS’s data products and statistical services.</p>


<p>DOS is currently exploring new AI initiatives that focus on data collection, such as expanding our in-house web-scraping capabilities and utilising optical character recognition technology to extract information and code directly from files and records. Additionally, efforts are being made to improve the user experience in searching for relevant information and data as part of data dissemination. These initiatives are aimed at continually enhancing the collection, production, and consumption of statistical data in Singapore. As AI evolves with better capabilities and greater proficiency, DOS expects to discover more statistical use cases for this promising technology in future.</p>
