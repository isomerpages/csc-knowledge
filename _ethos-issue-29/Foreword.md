<p>In 2001, Singapore experienced a severe recession. The dot-com bubble
had burst and global demand for electronics fell sharply. The September
11 attacks in the US further destabilised global markets, exacerbating
the economic downturn.</p>
<p>The Government established an Economic Review Committee (ERC) to chart
a path to economic recovery, as well as longer-term strategies for sustainable
growth. The ERC recognised that economic restructuring would lead to more
frequent job displacements for Singaporeans, as people’s skills became
obsolete. It recommended the creation of a Continuing Education and Training
body to promote lifelong learning, so that Singaporeans could remain employable
in a rapidly changing world. This led to the decision to set up the Workforce
Development Agency (WDA).</p>
<p>By the time we established the WDA in September 2003, the world had become
even more uncertain. SARS had disrupted economies and livelihoods. Nearly
26,000 Singaporeans lost their jobs in just three months, and our unemployment
rate soared to a high of 4.7% that year.</p>
<p>As WDA’s first Chief Executive, my then team faced the urgent mission
of helping over 85,000 unemployed Singaporeans re-enter the workforce.
Through initiatives like the Workforce Skills Qualification system and
Place-and-Train programmes, we began efforts to equip workers with the
skills needed to adapt to the changed economic landscape.</p>
<p>WDA’s efforts represented Singapore’s first national push to embed skills
upgrading and lifelong learning into our workforce and societal culture,
laying the foundation for what would later become the SkillsFuture movement.</p>
<h4>A Decade of Transformation</h4>
<p>The SkillsFuture movement was launched in 2015 to empower every Singaporean
to develop skills mastery and pursue their aspirations.</p>
<p>In 2016, we restructured WDA to create SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and
Workforce Singapore (WSG), to provide sharper focus to the range of work
needed to drive skills development and employability. Building on WDA’s
decade of groundwork, SSG fostered a culture of lifelong learning, while
WSG enabled quality employment opportunities.</p>
<p>To date, over a million Singaporeans have used their SkillsFuture Credit
to upskill themselves. Our Work-Study Programmes have also helped graduates
secure better wages, and supported many jobseekers and mid-career workers
in making successful career transitions.</p>
<h4>Familiar, Yet Different Waters</h4>
<p>Today’s operating context is once again uncertain and volatile. But this
time round, economic headwinds, trade tensions, and geopolitical contestation
have introduced new challenges. We also face a pace of technological advancement
that has made some skills obsolete faster than ever. But these new challenges
also present new opportunities for us.</p>
<p>The Public Service stands at the forefront of responding to these challenges.
Among other efforts, the Government is charting out a new economic blueprint
for Singapore, and fundamentally rethinking the skills our workforce needs
to stay ahead of disruption.</p>
<p>For example, the ability of AI to replicate and even outperform human
tasks can create anxieties for workers. Yet AI also offers significant
productivity gains. Many of our public officers already use tools like
Pair to support them in drafting meeting notes and speeches. Our frontline
agencies also deploy AI chatbots, among other tools, to improve operations
and service delivery.</p>
<p>To harness AI effectively in our work, the Public Service must find new
ways to add value from the use of this new technology. This starts with
being open to new ideas and new ways of working.</p>
<h4>Building a Future-Ready Public Service</h4>
<p>We are not starting from scratch. Over the years, we have stepped up our
efforts to strengthen skills training and lifelong learning across the
Public Service.</p>
<p>One such area is in mastering technology. Since last year, the Permanent
Secretaries and Senior Public Service Leaders have undergone digital training
on a variety of topics, including modernising digital products, data, and
AI. These equip us to make better decisions as we drive digital strategy,
build capabilities, and effect change in our organisations.</p>
<p>We are progressively equipping all our public officers with digital, data
and AI (“DDA”) skills, so that every officer can mainstream these tools
in daily work. We have recently rolled out a mandatory AI literacy course
for all public officers.</p>
<p>We have also developed new support tools for skills training and lifelong
learning. For example, CSC’s enhanced LEARN platform personalises the learning
experience for every officer, tailoring recommendations to them based on
their jobs and career goals. Officers and supervisors can also use the
One Talent Gateway to explore career pathways and access development opportunities.</p>
<p>These efforts are not merely boxes to tick or tools to download. They
embody the spirit and mindset of lifelong learning that each of us must
commit to, and actively participate in.</p>
<p>I ask that each of us make lifelong learning part of our regular routine.
Dedicate at least an hour weekly to learn something new or try a new AI
tool. Apply this knowledge to improve our daily work processes. Encourage
your colleagues to do the same. Because it is this attitude of continuous
learning and growth that will allow us to keep making our Public Service
better than it was yesterday.</p>
<h4>Our Continuing Mission</h4>
<p>The Singapore story has always been about defying the odds, through resilience,
tenacity, and the relentless pursuit of excellence. As stewards of this
story, we must regularly ask ourselves what it takes to keep the Singapore
story going.</p>
<p>The answer will evolve as the world continues to change, technology advances,
and our people’s needs and aspirations evolve. We will therefore have to
continually adapt and innovate to ensure our governance stays relevant
and effective.</p>
<p>The SkillsFuture movement — and the spirit of lifelong learning that it
champions — is central to this effort. When we commit to continuous learning,
we ensure that our Public Service stays adaptable and future ready. We
also help to uplift skills and workforce development across industry sectors,
through our agencies’ roles as industry regulators and developers. Most
importantly, by role-modelling this spirit, we demonstrate to Singaporeans
that transformation is not something that happens to us, but something
that we can make happen ourselves. In doing so, we exemplify how to embrace
change, pursue growth, and contribute meaningfully to our nation’s continuing
story.</p>
<p>Together with Singaporeans, this is how we will keep writing the next
chapter of the Singapore story.</p>
