<h2>Asking the Right Questions</h2>

<p>The number <b>42</b> was made famous by Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, as the ultimate answer to "Life, the Universe, and Everything", as computed by the alien supercomputer Deep Thought. The plot twist is that nobody knows what question it is the answer to. Beyond the humour of Adams' fiction, 42 embodies a deeper truth: answers are meaningless without the right questions.</p>

<p>This insight aligns with the core of computational thinking: defining the problem is often harder than designing the solution. Real-world problems rarely come neatly packaged, and it is often difficult to pinpoint what the core question or problem statement is. For developers, 42 is a playful reminder that <b>context matters</b>. Similarly, in AI and data science, models can output precise predictions, but without framing the right context and question, precision is meaningless.</p>

<p>Today, technologies such as AI are evolving faster than education programmes can adapt, potentially leaving graduates with knowledge and skills that can quickly become obsolete. In response, alternative models of education have begun to emerge, offering new approaches to continuous learning that are more agile, timely, flexible than traditional, more rigid educational structures. One such alternative model is the school 42.</p>

<p>42 is a global, tuition-free software "IT" school founded in Paris in 2013. It offers a teacher-less, class-less learning environment focused entirely on peer-to-peer collaboration and project-based learning in a gamified environment. Its mission is to democratise access to high-quality tech education and produce adaptable, job-ready software engineers who thrive in fast-changing digital environments. 42's unique educational model has been adopted by a global network of more than 50 tuition-free coding schools in over 30 countries: the 42 network.</p>

<p>In 2021, the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with 42 to bring its innovative approach to Singapore. In 2023, SUTD's 42 Singapore (42SG) joined the global 42 network, offering a unique coding education programme aligned with the pedagogical principles shared by SUTD and 42, including an emphasis on human-centred education, peer learning, and project-based learning.</p>



<h3>1. Zero Tuition Fees</h3>

<p>Supported by SkillsFuture Singapore and a donor group of individuals and enterprises, the 42SG programme is completely tuition-fee free. This removes a major barrier to entry, especially for those from lower-income backgrounds or those hesitant to invest in expensive bootcamps or degrees.</p>

<h3>2. Teacher-less, Class-less, Peer-to-Peer learning</h3>

<p>Students learn by doing in the 42SG programme. There are no lectures, no teachers, and no handholding. Students learn to solve problems via peer-learning pedagogy. Instead of professors delivering lectures, students learn by sharing with each other, collaborate, debate, and build solutions together. While this can be daunting for those used to structured environments, removing the teacher empowers learners to take ownership of their own progression. Learning is no longer just a one-way transfer from teacher to student but becomes a community goal that the student groups pursue together. This environment helps build communication skills, empathy, and teamwork: essential qualities in the modern workplace.</p>

<div class="containerbox">
<p class="break1">A significant aspect of the programme was the collaboration between different members...As we had very different working styles, we had to try to change our working styles to adapt and accommodate one another.</p>

<p class="break1">The peer-learning approach exposed me to different ways of thinking from seeing the work of others. Some of my best learnings had come from observing skilled peers approach and solve problems.</p>

</div>

<h3>3. Inclusivity and Open Access</h3>

<p>Anyone aged 18 and above can apply for 42SG, regardless of his or her academic background. This open access model democratises tech education and removes barriers for career switchers, self-taught coders, and those who may have been left behind by traditional education systems. By valuing diverse backgrounds, learning styles, and perspectives, 42SG fosters an inclusive community where everyone has the chance to succeed, regardless of prior education or experience — including those who might otherwise be excluded from the tech industry.</p>

<h3>4. Gamified Approach and Self-Paced Curriculum</h3>

<p>Progress is tracked as students complete and validate activities, much like in a video game. Students "level up" by completing increasingly complex challenges, which keeps motivation high and mirrors the iterative nature of software development. Admission into the programme is based on completing an online game that is both fun and challenging, along with performance during a month-long immersion programme known as the "Piscine", in which participants are evaluated on their persistence, problem-solving ability, and collaboration skills.</p>

<p>Recognising that education should not be one-size-fits-all, 42SG's learning journey is self-paced: fast learners accelerate; others take their time. This personalisation reflects real-world diversity in learning speeds. Gamification addresses the different levels of motivation and ability in students while igniting the passion of 'self-learning' in all of them.</p>

<div class="containerbox">
<p class="break1">The same passion that brought me to the Piscine continues to drive me. I want to stay committed to self learning and spend my evenings polishing my technical skills.</p>

<h3>5. Project-Based Learning</h3>

<p>Learning at 42SG is derived by completing projects. From day one, students dive into challenges that simulate the types of problems professional software developers face. Learners are encouraged to try, make mistakes, iterate, and learn by doing, just like in the real working world. They are empowered to actively construct knowledge rather than just passively absorb it. This nurtures creativity, resilience, and problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>Learning through failure empowers students to embrace uncertainty, build confidence, and develop a resilient, growth-oriented mindset. As a culture of 'failing forward' takes root across the community, it reshapes behaviours and fosters real transformation. Project-based learning also helps students build industry-ready portfolios: bridging the gap between school and the workplace.</p>

<div class="containerbox">
<p class="break1">42SG gave me the confidence to break into a new industry by building a strong foundation in software development. It trained me to think like an engineer again, but this time in code… The experience also instilled the discipline and resourcefulness needed to thrive in a self-directed learning environment skills that directly translate to success in tech.</p>

<h3>6. 24/7 Campus</h3>

<p>The 42SG campus is always open, allowing students to learn at their own pace. This flexibility is especially valuable for working adults, those with caregiving responsibilities, or those who prefer working at different hours.</p>

<h3>7. Global Network</h3>

<p>As part of the 42 network, 42SG students can collaborate with peers from over 50 campuses worldwide. This global exposure enhances learning and could potentially bring access to international career opportunities.</p>

<p>Since September 2023, 42SG has welcomed three diverse cohorts of 426 learners, with students aged 18 to 60 from varied educational, professional, and cultural backgrounds — including locals and internationals from 13 countries. Over half are employed full-time, while the other half are between jobs or exploring new paths, each bringing unique perspectives that enrich the community. There has also been a good mix of learners with different education levels, from those with secondary school education to pre-tertiary graduates and postgraduates.</p>

<p>Learning goes beyond coding: it is also about empathy, collaboration, and growth. The diversity of age, experience, and culture at 42SG fosters open-mindedness, deeper communication, and real-world teamwork. The 42SG programme does not just teach tech — it embraces individuals from all walks of life to intentionally build a human-centred, inclusive future, where many learn to thrive in the digital age.</p>

<h2>42SG: Realising Singapore's Future</h2>

<p>Singapore has long championed digital transformation. Initiatives such as Smart Nation, SkillsFuture, and the Digital Economy Framework for Action underscore the importance of tech talent. The 42SG programme aligns perfectly with these goals, with relevance reaching beyond tech into education and social outcomes.</p>

<h3>Supporting Lifelong Learning</h3>

<p>With strong support from SkillsFuture Singapore, 42SG welcomes learners of all ages, enabling career transitions and upskilling. This supports Singapore's vision of a resilient, adaptable workforce.</p>

<h3>Inclusivity</h3>

<p>By removing financial and academic barriers, 42SG promotes equity and inclusion. This is crucial in a meritocratic society that values opportunity for all.</p>

<h3>Filling Talent Gaps</h3>

<p>Singapore's economy is increasingly driven by digital innovation. As AI, automation, and cybersecurity reshape industries, the need for adaptable tech talent has never been greater. 42SG offers specialisations in high-demand areas, helping to fill the talent gap with agile, job-ready professionals in key fields such as Software Engineering, Web Development, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Mobile Development and Game Development.</p>

<h3>Driving Innovation</h3>

<p>An emphasis on creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving nurtures the kind of thinkers who can drive innovation in startups, corporates, and government agencies.</p>

<h3>Enhancing Competitiveness</h3>

<p>Talent attracts talent, and global competitiveness is forged through shared innovation. As part of the global 42 network, 42SG offers students a gateway to international exposure and collaboration, broadening horizons and strengthening Singapore's position in the talent economy.</p>

<p>At 42SG's inaugural graduation in May 2025, then Minister of State for Education and Manpower, Gan Siow Huang praised the programme as an "innovative and skills-based offering for learners."<sup><a href="#notestop">1</a></sup> She commended the resilience of all 18 diverse graduates, from mid-career switchers to fresh school leavers, and shared the inspiring journey of Valedictorian Jeremy, a former electrical technician who found his passion for coding at 42SG and earned a spot in Google's Skills Ignition traineeship.</p>

<p>Minister Gan also underscored the growing importance of soft skills like communication, collaboration, and creative problem-solving.</p>

<h2>The Challenge of Changing Education</h2>

<p>More than just a computer programming school, 42SG is a bold response to the future of work — empowering individuals, challenging convention, and teaching learners not just to code, but to adapt, lead, and thrive in a world of constant change.</p>

<p>However, pursuing a fundamentally new approach to education and skills development is not without its challenges. The 42SG approach continues to face hurdles in different areas.</p>

<h3>Conventional Education, Structures, Expectations and Norms</h3>

<p>Education in Singapore, as with many Asian societies, is shaped by rigorous academics, structure, and teacher-led instruction. The radical 42SG model has sparked mixed reactions, including scepticism. In many Asian cultures, teachers are more than educators: they are mentors, authority figures, and trusted guides. Removing this guiding figure can be unsettling. For some, the lack of spoon-feeding and handholding can be disorienting. For others, it is liberating and empowering, offering an opportunity to unlearn, adapt, and grow in ways traditional systems rarely allow.</p>

<h3>Peer-to-Peer, Self-Paced Learning</h3>

<p>Peer-to-peer, self-paced learning at 42SG demands strong intrinsic motivation and self-discipline — qualities not all students are equally prepared with. Traditional education often relies on external motivators like grades, exams, and teachers to keep learners on track. At 42SG, these are intentionally removed or re-invented. This is intended to develop grit, but it also leads to early dropouts: a trend seen both in Singapore and globally across 42 campuses.</p>


<p>The self-paced model is both empowering and demanding — a double-edged sword that tests not just skills, but resilience. Not everyone thrives when given total freedom from the start; some may need more structured transitions to build confidence and independence.</p>

<p>Many students struggle in the first months as they adjust to the full autonomy in learning 42SG demands. Not everyone thrives when given total freedom from the start; some may need more structured transitions to build confidence and independence. Furthermore, while students can progress at their own pace, this very flexibility also creates disparity within the community. Like a marathon, the gap between participants widens, and learners gradually drift apart: those who fall behind may feel isolated, increasing the risk of dropping out.</p>

<h3>Securing Internships and Jobs</h3>

<p>The 42SG programme also faces challenges in gaining recognition from employers and helping its students secure jobs, due to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>An Unconventional Learning Model:</strong> With no teachers, classes, or textbooks, 42SG's peer-to-peer, project-based approach is unfamiliar to many employers. This leads to misunderstanding of the skill sets acquired and scepticism about the depth and rigour of its training.</li>

<li><strong>Low employer Awareness and Trust:</strong> As a relatively new entrant in Singapore's education landscape, 42SG must work to build credibility and demonstrate that its graduates possess industry-relevant skills.</li>

<li><strong>Competition for Real-World Jobs:</strong> Non-traditional candidates find it challenging to stand out unless they bring highly specialised or in-demand skills.</li>

<li><strong>Difficulty in Assessing Soft Skills:</strong> Employers often struggle to evaluate soft skills—like communication and adaptability — which are critical in tech roles but not always evident from project portfolios alone. 42 develops and assesses soft skills within the programme. The 42 network will be incorporating metrics to measure these soft skills.</li>
</ul>


<p>Despite these hurdles, success stories such as Jeremy, demonstrate that the model can work in Singapore. Encouragingly, a growing number of enterprises are partnering 42SG. Among them is foodpanda, which has already hired some 42SG students.</p>

<p>The challenge for 42SG is to scale up these successes and deepen employer engagement. To this end, 42SG actively invites enterprises to collaborate by offering opportunities such as hackathon projects and internships for our students.</p>

<h2>Creating the Future Together</h2>

<p>Based on 42SG's philosophy of learning, here are three anchor principles for the future:</p>

<div class="notestop">
<ol>

<li><strong>The Future Is Now:</strong> AI is no longer a distant promise but a present reality. The challenge is not to prepare for AI someday, but to engage with it today — responsibly, critically, and creatively.</li>

<li><strong>Human–AI Symbiosis:</strong> The narrative is not about machines replacing people, but about forging a new partnership. AI amplifies human potential by handling scale, speed, and complexity, while humans bring judgment, empathy, and ethical reasoning. The future of learning lies in integration: systems where humans and AI complement each other rather than compete.</li>

<li><strong>Collaboration for Lifelong Learning and Innovation:</strong> No single institution, company, or government can address the skills challenge alone. Lifelong learning and innovation should be built on open frameworks, shared innovations, and collective responsibility across society. This means institutions like 42SG, employers, educators, policymakers, and learners themselves must co-create ecosystems that enable continuous growth and reinvention. The nature of lifelong learning is already changing. The deeper question is whether we are ready to shape its direction together, ensuring it is inclusive, ethical, and human-centred.</li>

</ol>
</div>
<br>
<div class="containerbox1">

<h3>Evolving 42SG in the Age of AI</h3>

<p>42 nurtures skills. AI offers augmentation. Design brings it all together, ensuring innovation is human-centred.</p>

<p>Since its founding, SUTD has always had human-centred design at its core. It recently made bold strides in its Design•AI initiative — reflecting its commitment to shaping a future where AI enhances human creativity, ethics, and innovation.<sup><a href="#notestop">2</a></sup> Since January 2025, it officially pivoted to become the world's first Design•AI university, integrating AI deeply into its curriculum, research, and enterprise efforts. For example, SUTD's expanded curriculum ensures all students are grounded in Design•AI alongside other major/minor offerings.</p>

<p>Housed and supported by SUTD, 42SG has a clear advantage in tapping on the University's Design•AI developments. The SUTD Academy's Design•AI offerings are now available to 42SG students. The intended outcome is to expand access to resources that enable more students to participate meaningfully in the AI-driven future.</p>

<p>With the continued rise of transformative technologies such as AI, we are witnessing a 'new' old phenomenon, where innovation once again disrupts how we live, learn, and work. Yet, amid this wave of change, the true value of 42 lies not merely in its philosophy of "no teachers", but in its <b>living, evolving curriculum</b>, one that mirrors the very nature of technology itself: <b>Continuous</b>, <b>Adaptive</b>, and <b>Progressive</b>.</p>

<p>In an age where AI redefines the boundaries of knowledge, 42 empowers learners to evolve alongside technology, cultivating 'power-skills' such as creativity, collaboration, and resilience — the timeless human skills that machines cannot replace.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the world of 42, the most fundamental outcome is to acquire the mind to ask the right questions, learn to find the way forward through failing, and in the process develop meta-skills that are for life rather than for the moment. More than a number, 42 is a philosophy of nurturing individuals who stay curious, embrace ambiguity, never stop asking better questions, and form communities.</p>

<p>The convergence of 42's radical pedagogy, SUTD's human-centred design, and the possibilities of AI, offers a living prototype of the future of education. It is disruptive, imperfect, and still unfolding. However, the principle is clear: the future of lifelong learning must be symbiotic. Human and AI, design and technology, competition and collaboration, all functioning together, for the good of all.</p>
