<p>From an unprecedented global pandemic to seismic geopolitical shifts and
game-changing technological advances, the past decade has given much cause
for learning and change. The pace at which we have been asked to reinvent
ourselves, our skills and our work has been disconcerting — and will not
relent anytime soon. For the past ten years, the SkillsFuture movement
has sought to prepare Singaporeans for an uncertain future, by nurturing
the attitudes, approaches and actors needed for a resilient workforce to
thrive in the face of anything tomorrow might hold.</p>
<p>This formidable task has called for efforts that span the whole of government.
In this special issue, we feature insights from current and past leaders
of the SkillsFuture movement as they reflect on how it has had to adapt,
learn and evolve as new challenges (and different needs) emerge.</p>
<p>To make SkillsFuture work, a strong network of partners across different
sectors has sprung up: this ecosystem now needs to be thoughtfully tended
and expanded. As a mindset of lifelong learning takes hold, and with a
growing pool of success stories to draw on, experts discuss how we can
now take a more systematic, informed approach, augmented with new tools
and technologies, to help Singaporeans realise the tangible benefits of
career design, mindful upskilling and organisational transformation.</p>
<p>The Singapore Public Service is both a key enabler of this national shift,
and a role model for what an empowered, skills-first and career health-oriented
work culture can look like. We hear from agencies who have reinvented themselves
with this spirit in mind, gleaning lessons for how organisations can work
hand in hand with their people today, to succeed in tomorrow’s brave new
world, together.</p>
<p>We thank our issue partners, SkillsFuture Singapore and Workforce Singapore,
for gathering these insights on the progress of the SkillsFuture movement,
its evolving efforts to support both individuals and employers, and exciting
prospects for the future of continual learning, career design, and workforce
transformation.</p>
<p>I wish you an inspiring read.</p>
