<h3>In your context, what are some of the most significant challenges facing government today, and how are you addressing them?</h3>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #76923c;">MULLIGAN</span>:</strong> At the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in Ireland, we face four main challenges that have become more acute in recent years, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p>The first is our labour supply and the international competition for talent. Ireland’s enterprise base includes a large cohort of multinational companies many of which come from foreign direct investment. One of our priorities is to develop indigenous Irish-owned companies to rebalance the economy. In this context competition for talent is a challenge but we find there is a lot of movement of workers between these cohorts with many workers from MNCs starting up their own companies so we have a big focus on helping business to start and scale.</p>
<p>The second challenge is what we call the twin transition—the need to pursue digitalisation as well as decarbonisation in light of climate change. We are working to address these goals with businesses and the public at large. To some degree, the pandemic gave us a terrific platform for more businesses to go online.</p>
<p>A third challenge has to do with the global trend towards deglobalisation and protectionism. Like Singapore, we are a small open economy that is heavily reliant on trade for our economic prosperity. On the other hand, the shortening of global supply chains could also present an opportunity for us that we could harness.</p>


<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #4f81bd;">HUOT</span>:</strong></span>  Since the pandemic, many countries, including Cambodia, have experienced slower economic growth, and prospects remain uncertain. People are concerned about their living standards. This is why the government has focused on how to bring back growth. Before the pandemic, Cambodia’s GDP would grow 7% to 10% a year; now we are looking at around 5% annual growth.</p> 
<p>Cambodia elected a new government in 2023. The people have high expectations of public service delivery from the new administration. To meet these expectations, the government is taking a collaborative approach, working together with other stakeholders to meet these goals. This means that managing and improving public trust in government has become a key concern for us.</p> 
<p>We are also looking to digital technology to help us improve service delivery and transform our public sector. But we are also keeping a close eye on its risks, such as the impact on privacy and cybersecurity.</p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #ff2324;">SUHARTI</span>:</strong> In Indonesia, our challenge is to make sure that our children have access to good quality schooling. One of our priorities at the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology is to help our young people do well, not only academically, but also in terms of character building to prepare them for the future.</span></p> 
<p>At the end of 2019, analysis showed that up to half of all Indonesian students had failed to reach minimum competence in numeracy and many also did not reach minimum literacy, based on international PISA standards.<sup>1</sup> Our Minister declared this an emergency, prompting us to accelerate efforts to ensure our young people develop these fundamental competencies. Apart from basic skill problem, we also have some issues with bully, sexual abuse, and intolerance, which is what we are trying to address through character building programmes in schools.</p>
<p>A related challenge is to improve the quality of our teachers. With more than four million teachers in Indonesia, it is impossible, with our limited resources, to provide regular training for all of them. So, we need to find alternative ways to support them, such as digital platforms for teacher training and professional development. </p>

<h3>How are you adopting digitalisation to address the challenges you face?</h3>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #ff2324;">SUHARTI</span>:</strong> In general, digitalisation is a central priority for the Indonesian government. We have set up units to provide dedicated support for digitalisation strategies across the public sector. </span></p>
<p>For education, we have developed a digital platform to provide materials for our teachers, including training videos, and to enable them to learn from one another. Some two million teachers are already on the platform. The rapid adoption of online methods by teachers as well as students has been very encouraging.</p>
<p>We have also computerised our assessments, including its reporting system, that enables schools to compare their performance with other schools in the area. Through the assessment data, we hope we can help schools and local governments in planning and prioritising challenges. The data provided includes data on literacy, numeracy, statistics on bullying risks and so on.</p>
<p>Digital systems will also make it easier for our schools to prepare their reports to the Ministry, and to manage their financial resources. Not all schools have good access to the internet, so our computerised systems are also available both online and offline. We have also set up an e-commerce system to help schools procure supplies they need, and it has already attracted thousands of business partners.</p>
<p>Looking forward, we have been thinking about how we can use artificial intelligence (AI) to help teachers prepare their lesson plans and teaching materials, which will save them time. We have been in talks with Open AI on these possibilities. We are also working with leading companies, such as Google, and have established internship programmes so that our young people can benefit from the experience and grow into the digital talent Indonesia will need in future. We hope to groom over one million digital talents in the next few years.</p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #76923c;">MULLIGAN</span>:</strong> Ireland has a comprehensive national digital strategy which sets out what we are doing: in terms of building infrastructure, the skills we need to have, digitalising public services, and supporting enterprise. It is about putting the systems and processes in place.</span></p>
<p>For AI, one of our priorities is to build trust, given public concern about the technology. Our national AI strategy is called “AI—Here For Good”,<sup>2</sup> which has a double meaning: AI is going to be here to stay, and it is here to do good. We want to make sure the use of AI is ethical, beneficial and people-centred. We have also appointed an AI Ambassador, a youth council, and an advisory board to advise government on related issues. Our AI strategies are about a year old, and we should be getting our first progress reports on how the implementation has proceeded. Our priority is to establish facts about the technology, and to hear from informed voices, in order to reassure people about the use of this new technology.</p>
<p>Ireland, and especially Dublin, has done well in terms of attracting major high-tech companies. They have been anchored in the business ecosystem for many years now, and we have seen a transfer of knowledge to Irish companies. We now have our own Irish startups, entrepreneurs, research centres and so on, who are becoming part of the supply chain for the multinationals.</p>
<p>All these developments reinforce our sense of responsibility for regulation—both because of the concern about public trust, and because we host so many large tech companies involved in this work on our own turf, so to speak. We are putting in place the pieces of the digital regulation jigsaw, so that we have a strong foundation for the future.</p> 
<p>In the past, an attractive tax regime might have been an important aspect of our competitive advantage, but now the multinationals have said that regulation is vital. Businesses like to know what the rules are, and that they will be enforced. That clarity is part of what makes us an attractive business environment.</p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #4f81bd;">HUOT</span>:</strong></span> I want to point out something here. If you’re looking to build a family,
a sibling might say: don’t worry about me, I can take care of my own. But when you care about the family you want everyone to do well, and to have strong bonds between members. But if we don’t understand the problems that each other is facing, and neglect the needs that we ourselves don’t face in our own situation, then it will be harder to understand and support one another. So we may want to have a research centre where we highlight our problems and address them together, rather than to have a central body where we go to ask for help.</p>



<h3>How Can Singapore Contribute to Help ASEAN Work More Closely Together?</h3>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #76923c;">YII</span>:</strong></span> I think there are several challenges that Singapore faces in a changing world. How Singapore prepares itself to meet these challenges will be something others can learn from. </p>

<p>The first is of course the economy. While meritocracy has led to good results, it may also have led to inequality. The global economy has become a bit sluggish and Singapore may be impacted. Once people start losing jobs and comparing their lot with their neighbours, there may be a human tendency to fall back on communitarian politics. If we are not careful, this can end up dominating the conversation. Singapore has been hitting above its weight class—a testament to good leadership—but has it peaked, given the competition all around, particularly with the digital economy? This is where Singapore has to be creative and innovate. </p>

<p>Second is the leadership transition. Given changing public expectations, can the next generation of leadership steer Singapore in the new direction that it will need to go remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The future is a whole different ball game, and—this applies not just to Singapore but every country—you may want to keep doing what you are already good at, but the world may be moving on to a different ballgame, that you can’t dictate, as a small country.</p>

<p>The third in my view is healthcare. What’s close to my heart is the software of humans, that is to say mental health. With greater digitalisation comes a changing environment in terms of jobs and competition as well as social media, cyberbullying, social isolation and so on. There are not only physical effects but a mental impact, such as the stress of work as well as of social expectations, that you’d have to be prepared for.</p>

<div class="break">

<p class="break1">
Singapore is in a good position to help look for opportunities and challenges, by reaching out  to colleagues who are open.
</p>

</div>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #4f81bd;">BOROS</span>:</strong></span> I raised the idea of ASEAN as a family earlier: if you want a family where trust is strong, you have to help one another out. So we’ve talked about identifying a common challenge. For a family of 10, it might be, say, what to watch on TV together. But what about the brother who does not have enough food on his table? Would he rather think about food or TV?</p>

<p>So for me, it’s not so much about the common challenge as the real needs.
If you want to have a strong family, you look out for the real needs of each of your family members. Then they don’t have to look elsewhere for help.</p>

<p>I think Singapore is already a hub for the world: so you can see where the transition of our region is going. Singapore is in a good position to help look for opportunities and challenges, by reaching out to colleagues who are open. It is not the ASEAN way to come and ask for help. But in a strong family, you go ahead and help—you don’t wait for your family members to ask. You say: “We are family, I see what you need, this is what I can offer, think about it.”</p>

<p class="small-text"><em>The ETHOS Roundtable was conducted in August 2019 with a group of participants in the 12th Leaders in Governance Programme (LGP). Organised annually by the Civil Service College, the LGP draws from Singapore’s development experience to offer practical insights into the fundamentals of good governance and effective policy implementation for sustainable economic development and social cohesion. Over the seven-day programme, participants interact with thought leaders, and visit key government agencies to understand their operating philosophies and values.</em></p>
