<h3>Tell us about your current work and how it relates to evidence-based policymaking.</h3>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #4f81bd;">AARON</span>:</strong></span>  As Director for Digital Transformation Education at the Blavatnik School of Government in Oxford, part of my job is to think about how governments use, regulate and enable technology  more effectively.</p> 
<p>There are three particularly strong intersections between the digital space and evidence-based policymaking. First, digitalisation is in many ways synonymous with being more data-driven. Digitalisation means we have access to far more data, both qualitative and quantitative, than we have ever had before. There is both a lot of noise, and more evidence that we can use. So governments need to learn how to harness this abundance and have the literacy to sift through the noise and discern substance from it.</p>
<p>Second, governments want to know what actually works or does not work in the digital transformation process that public agencies go through. We need evidence-based approaches to determine this more clearly. </p>
<p>The third aspect has to do with what competencies are needed in government in order to digitise well: I based my PhD on this! For instance, the more we outsource digital transformation, the more we need the right skills inside government to use and discern what is going on in the digital space. A key set of skills here involve data literacy and analytic literacy—understanding what is out there and what we can use to inform decision-making in more effective ways. </p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #ff2324;">ELEANOR</span>:</strong> I am Research Director at the Blavatnik School’s Government Outcomes Lab (GO Lab). We are a research centre that investigates how government partners with the private and not-for-profit sectors, in particular to improve public service delivery. Our work is very much applied research—we produce scholarly work, but we also serve as a bridge to government agencies, supporting them in partnering better.</span></p> 
<p>After over 30 years of using different forms of public-private partnership, what we can say about what works is actually still very limited. So part of the GO Lab’s mission is to develop the evidence base around government partnerships, and developing an understanding of how the government can appropriately partner. This includes thinking about using an outcomes focus in a way that improves cross-sector partnerships.</p> <p>
An outcomes-oriented framework, either within government or in the way the government works with partners, could energise the ways in which different forms of data and evidence intersect with decision-making across the full policy-development process, in a positive feedback loop. </p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #76923c;">LEON</span>:</strong> The Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) strives to be a trusted research partner for the Singapore Government. We are starting an initiative called SCOPE (Social Compact, Outcomes, Partnerships and Engagement), which aims to encourage the non-profit sector in Singapore to become more outcomes-oriented, by fostering a virtuous cycle where the various parties in the non-profit ecosystem—funders, sector developers, non-profit organisations, etc. continuously learn from one another, turning new insights into better implementation and improved social impact. In this way, we can encourage more participation between people, private, and public sectors to tackle social issues as part of a refreshed social compact.</span></p>
	
<h3>What is evidence-based policymaking to you? What constitutes evidence in the context of policymaking?</h3>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #4f81bd;">AARON</span>:</strong></span> To me, evidence-based policymaking is grounded in testing and experimentation. It is finding out what really works in practice. Ideas should be proven to work not just in one or two places, but across a whole range of different settings. For example, we should not assume that just because something has worked in New Zealand or Estonia that it will work elsewhere.</p> 
<p>Related to this is finding out which are generalisable principles, and which are the more context-specific ideas that may have to be adjusted for culture, tradition and different locations. A lot of this boils down to actual practice, that is well documented and well coded. And where we do not know something, we test things out first through experiments, pilots, or talking to people.</p>
<p>I do find that there is a bias in favour of quantitative, hard, tangible evidence in policy circles. There is going to be bias in quantitative evidence also, of course. Sometimes the best thing we can do is to identify broad trends illuminated by quantitative data, and then also test them with smaller scale stories and individual narratives that come out of ethnographic and qualitative data. I do hope we as researchers can help address this bias, and that governments start to broaden the repertoire of data they use.</p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #ff2324;">ELEANOR</span>:</strong> For me, evidence-based policymaking is about working in a way that integrates and absorbs research and evidence. As Aaron has pointed out, there needs to also be a deep contextualisation and appreciation around what works. A lot of evidence-based policymaking is often skewed to the top of the Maryland Scale,<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup>  and we end up inappropriately mimicking evidence-based medicine by being fixated on trial evidence and intervention. </span></p>
<p>What we understand as evidence in policymaking does need to be more well-rounded and refined, rather than taking it as meaning only data from randomised controlled trials.</p>

<div class="break">

<p class="break1">
There needs to be more platforms and opportunities for different parts of the ecosystem to come together and talk.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #76923c;">LEON</span>:</strong> I agree on what Eleanor and Aaron have said about evidence, and I am concerned about how we can marry both qualitative and quantitative approaches. For example, a big issue with using quantitative methods in the non-profit sector in Singapore is that many interventions have very small sample sizes, which limits the usefulness of the results from such methods. On the other hand, qualitative methods give you rich detail but also raise questions about whether findings can be generalised. I believe what we need are new syntheses of quantitative and qualitative methods. We have the range of technical expertise to do these in Singapore, but there needs to be more platforms and opportunities for people from different parts of the ecosystem to come together and talk about how to combine these approaches to create useful, practical evidence in cost-effective ways.</span></p>
<p>There is a real hunger for more information and better evidence of what is going on, and what is working. That said, what works for government may actually be quite different from what works for the non-profit’s point of view. </p>

<h3>In your view, what are some aspects of governance we should all be thinking more about?</h3>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #ff2324;">SUHARTI</span>:</strong> I think we are not attending enough to the empathetic side of governance. Sometimes we want to make change quickly, without taking enough into account other stakeholders’ feelings or needs. We need to do more to help people see that changes will be truly beneficial for them, not just for the government, or for senior management. </span></p>
<p>We must also not forget those who are left behind, especially as we pursue these technological developments. We cannot just roll out the infrastructure and expect everyone to come on board. We need to mitigate the risks and help to bridge inequality of access. We must also bear in mind those who may have difficulty using the new systems.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #76923c;">MULLIGAN</span>:</strong></span> I have been thinking about the difference between managers and leaders. Managers make sure things are done right, while leaders make sure we are doing the right things. But I also think that in leading us into the future, leaders should make sure we are doing the right thing, as well as the right things. And then looking to do things right to get us there. All of these are important from a governance point of view.</p>
<p>As the pace of change and pace of decision-making accelerates, we should remember to take time to consult with people; to listen so that we know to do things better and to do the right thing even as we need to make decisions faster. </p>
<p>We also need systems and processes to make sure we take care of all of these aspects of governance. As was pointed out recently, there is no such thing as an evil civil servant. It is usually a system or process that has failed, rather than an individual. </p>
<p>As leaders, we are responsible for charting new paths that may require us to do things differently, in a way that has never been done before, because there is no playbook for the new. This may mean disrupting established processes. But those processes are also important to protect our staff and the public interest. As a leader, there is a tension in having to do new things while also needing to have appropriate processes and safeguards in place.</p>
<p>We need to be empowering people to take risks because we cannot innovate otherwise. But we also need to be managing the risks. How might we resolve this balancing act as we move deeper into uncharted territory?</p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #4f81bd;">HUOT</span>:</strong></span> Having systems and processes in place is important, but we also need to pay attention to mindsets and culture. We must remember that people do not all think the same way in a society. People with different backgrounds may have different understandings of any change, for instance. </p>
<p>This is also why Cambodia is trying to strengthen the capability of our people. In government, we are planning to train and upskill some 1.5 million of youth from poor and vulnerable families through training programmes, so that they can better support the coming reforms. Our human resources are the starting point for meaningful change.</p>

<h3>What did you find noteworthy during your time in Singapore for the LGP?</h3>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #ff2324;">SUHARTI</span>:</strong> In Singapore, a much smaller country than Indonesia, the government plays a relatively larger role. But I have noticed a strong alignment among government leaders, which means programmes can be executed more effectively. </span></p>
<p>Having worked in the Indonesian government for over 32 years, I have had many interactions with Singaporean officials. I also notice that there has been a change over time: they are now much more open, and more prepared to share information and to collaborate across boundaries.</p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #76923c;">MULLIGAN</span>:</strong></span> I have been struck by the alignment across government, in terms of the direction, ambition and determination to deliver. There has been a very strong focus on evidence-based policymaking, measurable results and performance indicators. It points to the need to continually sense check the outcomes of what we do—to look at what the evidence is really telling us.</p>
<p>At the same time, my impression is that all of these are informed by a sense of compassionate empathy: that all this is for and about the people. We are building up our economy, and our infrastructure, for the good of society.</p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #4f81bd;">HUOT</span>:</strong></span> In Cambodia, we also want to be regarded as a government that takes care of its people. Singapore does this in a whole-of-nation way, by involving different stakeholders and society at large. While we also work towards this in my country, not all actors are actively involved in the processes of governance. </p>
<p>My time in Singapore has been a reminder to better engage more stakeholders, so that our government policies can be more tangible for and applicable to people with different needs. </p>
