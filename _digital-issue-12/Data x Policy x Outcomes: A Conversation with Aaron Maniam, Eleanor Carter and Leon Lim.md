<h3>Tell us about your current work and how it relates to evidence-based policymaking.</h3>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #4f81bd;">AARON</span>:</strong></span>  As Director for Digital Transformation Education at the Blavatnik School of Government in Oxford, part of my job is to think about how governments use, regulate and enable technology  more effectively.</p> 
<p>There are three particularly strong intersections between the digital space and evidence-based policymaking. First, digitalisation is in many ways synonymous with being more data-driven. Digitalisation means we have access to far more data, both qualitative and quantitative, than we have ever had before. There is both a lot of noise, and more evidence that we can use. So governments need to learn how to harness this abundance and have the literacy to sift through the noise and discern substance from it.</p>
<p>Second, governments want to know what actually works or does not work in the digital transformation process that public agencies go through. We need evidence-based approaches to determine this more clearly. </p>
<p>The third aspect has to do with what competencies are needed in government in order to digitise well: I based my PhD on this! For instance, the more we outsource digital transformation, the more we need the right skills inside government to use and discern what is going on in the digital space. A key set of skills here involve data literacy and analytic literacy—understanding what is out there and what we can use to inform decision-making in more effective ways. </p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #ff2324;">ELEANOR</span>:</strong> I am Research Director at the Blavatnik School’s Government Outcomes Lab (GO Lab). We are a research centre that investigates how government partners with the private and not-for-profit sectors, in particular to improve public service delivery. Our work is very much applied research—we produce scholarly work, but we also serve as a bridge to government agencies, supporting them in partnering better.</span></p> 
<p>After over 30 years of using different forms of public-private partnership, what we can say about what works is actually still very limited. So part of the GO Lab’s mission is to develop the evidence base around government partnerships, and developing an understanding of how the government can appropriately partner. This includes thinking about using an outcomes focus in a way that improves cross-sector partnerships.</p> <p>
An outcomes-oriented framework, either within government or in the way the government works with partners, could energise the ways in which different forms of data and evidence intersect with decision-making across the full policy-development process, in a positive feedback loop. </p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #76923c;">LEON</span>:</strong> The Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) strives to be a trusted research partner for the Singapore Government. We are starting an initiative called SCOPE (Social Compact, Outcomes, Partnerships and Engagement), which aims to encourage the non-profit sector in Singapore to become more outcomes-oriented, by fostering a virtuous cycle where the various parties in the non-profit ecosystem—funders, sector developers, non-profit organisations, etc. continuously learn from one another, turning new insights into better implementation and improved social impact. In this way, we can encourage more participation between people, private, and public sectors to tackle social issues as part of a refreshed social compact.</span></p>
	
<h3>How are you adopting digitalisation to address the challenges you face?</h3>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #ff2324;">SUHARTI</span>:</strong> In general, digitalisation is a central priority for the Indonesian government. We have set up units to provide dedicated support for digitalisation strategies across the public sector. </span></p>
<p>For education, we have developed a digital platform to provide materials for our teachers, including training videos, and to enable them to learn from one another. Some two million teachers are already on the platform. The rapid adoption of online methods by teachers as well as students has been very encouraging.</p>
<p>We have also computerised our assessments, including its reporting system, that enables schools to compare their performance with other schools in the area. Through the assessment data, we hope we can help schools and local governments in planning and prioritising challenges. The data provided includes data on literacy, numeracy, statistics on bullying risks and so on.</p>
<p>Digital systems will also make it easier for our schools to prepare their reports to the Ministry, and to manage their financial resources. Not all schools have good access to the internet, so our computerised systems are also available both online and offline. We have also set up an e-commerce system to help schools procure supplies they need, and it has already attracted thousands of business partners.</p>
<p>Looking forward, we have been thinking about how we can use artificial intelligence (AI) to help teachers prepare their lesson plans and teaching materials, which will save them time. We have been in talks with Open AI on these possibilities. We are also working with leading companies, such as Google, and have established internship programmes so that our young people can benefit from the experience and grow into the digital talent Indonesia will need in future. We hope to groom over one million digital talents in the next few years.</p>

<div class="break">

<p class="break1">
We want to make sure the use of AI is ethical, beneficial and people-centred.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #76923c;">MULLIGAN</span>:</strong> Ireland has a comprehensive national digital strategy which sets out what we are doing: in terms of building infrastructure, the skills we need to have, digitalising public services, and supporting enterprise. It is about putting the systems and processes in place.</span></p>
<p>For AI, one of our priorities is to build trust, given public concern about the technology. Our national AI strategy is called “AI—Here For Good”,<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup> which has a double meaning: AI is going to be here to stay, and it is here to do good. We want to make sure the use of AI is ethical, beneficial and people-centred. We have also appointed an AI Ambassador, a youth council, and an advisory board to advise government on related issues. Our AI strategies are about a year old, and we should be getting our first progress reports on how the implementation has proceeded. Our priority is to establish facts about the technology, and to hear from informed voices, in order to reassure people about the use of this new technology.</p>
<p>Ireland, and especially Dublin, has done well in terms of attracting major high-tech companies. They have been anchored in the business ecosystem for many years now, and we have seen a transfer of knowledge to Irish companies. We now have our own Irish startups, entrepreneurs, research centres and so on, who are becoming part of the supply chain for the multinationals.</p>
<p>All these developments reinforce our sense of responsibility for regulation—both because of the concern about public trust, and because we host so many large tech companies involved in this work on our own turf, so to speak. We are putting in place the pieces of the digital regulation jigsaw, so that we have a strong foundation for the future.</p> 
<p>In the past, an attractive tax regime might have been an important aspect of our competitive advantage, but now the multinationals have said that regulation is vital. Businesses like to know what the rules are, and that they will be enforced. That clarity is part of what makes us an attractive business environment.</p>


<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #4f81bd;">HUOT</span>:</strong></span> In 2021, Cambodia put in place a policy framework to develop a digital economy and society. As part of this initiative, we have been laying the foundations for our digital transformation in government. We have set up an interministerial working group as a collaborative approach, including government and private sector stakeholders, to pursue this. We feel this is a good way to build trust in government as well as to advance our national goals.</p>
<p>Even as we improve public service delivery, we are also using technology to improve business and other systems. For instance, we are looking into data policies that will allow us to use personalised data, such as what banks already have access to, to improve services, while protecting data ownership, security and privacy.</p>
<p>We are also working to assess the implications for AI, because we are concerned about its impact on society. One worry is that AI may replace humans in certain jobs, which could impact the many people in the Cambodian workforce who are still dependent on paper-based methods. We need to support and stand up for these people, even as we embrace new digital opportunities.</p>


<h3>In your view, what are some aspects of governance we should all be thinking more about?</h3>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #ff2324;">SUHARTI</span>:</strong> I think we are not attending enough to the empathetic side of governance. Sometimes we want to make change quickly, without taking enough into account other stakeholders’ feelings or needs. We need to do more to help people see that changes will be truly beneficial for them, not just for the government, or for senior management. </span></p>
<p>We must also not forget those who are left behind, especially as we pursue these technological developments. We cannot just roll out the infrastructure and expect everyone to come on board. We need to mitigate the risks and help to bridge inequality of access. We must also bear in mind those who may have difficulty using the new systems.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #76923c;">MULLIGAN</span>:</strong></span> I have been thinking about the difference between managers and leaders. Managers make sure things are done right, while leaders make sure we are doing the right things. But I also think that in leading us into the future, leaders should make sure we are doing the right thing, as well as the right things. And then looking to do things right to get us there. All of these are important from a governance point of view.</p>
<p>As the pace of change and pace of decision-making accelerates, we should remember to take time to consult with people; to listen so that we know to do things better and to do the right thing even as we need to make decisions faster. </p>
<p>We also need systems and processes to make sure we take care of all of these aspects of governance. As was pointed out recently, there is no such thing as an evil civil servant. It is usually a system or process that has failed, rather than an individual. </p>
<p>As leaders, we are responsible for charting new paths that may require us to do things differently, in a way that has never been done before, because there is no playbook for the new. This may mean disrupting established processes. But those processes are also important to protect our staff and the public interest. As a leader, there is a tension in having to do new things while also needing to have appropriate processes and safeguards in place.</p>
<p>We need to be empowering people to take risks because we cannot innovate otherwise. But we also need to be managing the risks. How might we resolve this balancing act as we move deeper into uncharted territory?</p>

</p>

</div>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #4f81bd;">HUOT</span>:</strong></span> Having systems and processes in place is important, but we also need to pay attention to mindsets and culture. We must remember that people do not all think the same way in a society. People with different backgrounds may have different understandings of any change, for instance. </p>
<p>This is also why Cambodia is trying to strengthen the capability of our people. In government, we are planning to train and upskill some 1.5 million of youth from poor and vulnerable families through training programmes, so that they can better support the coming reforms. Our human resources are the starting point for meaningful change.</p>

<h3>What did you find noteworthy during your time in Singapore for the LGP?</h3>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #ff2324;">SUHARTI</span>:</strong> In Singapore, a much smaller country than Indonesia, the government plays a relatively larger role. But I have noticed a strong alignment among government leaders, which means programmes can be executed more effectively. </span></p>
<p>Having worked in the Indonesian government for over 32 years, I have had many interactions with Singaporean officials. I also notice that there has been a change over time: they are now much more open, and more prepared to share information and to collaborate across boundaries.</p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #76923c;">MULLIGAN</span>:</strong></span> I have been struck by the alignment across government, in terms of the direction, ambition and determination to deliver. There has been a very strong focus on evidence-based policymaking, measurable results and performance indicators. It points to the need to continually sense check the outcomes of what we do—to look at what the evidence is really telling us.</p>
<p>At the same time, my impression is that all of these are informed by a sense of compassionate empathy: that all this is for and about the people. We are building up our economy, and our infrastructure, for the good of society.</p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-10"><strong><span style="color: #4f81bd;">HUOT</span>:</strong></span> In Cambodia, we also want to be regarded as a government that takes care of its people. Singapore does this in a whole-of-nation way, by involving different stakeholders and society at large. While we also work towards this in my country, not all actors are actively involved in the processes of governance. </p>
<p>My time in Singapore has been a reminder to better engage more stakeholders, so that our government policies can be more tangible for and applicable to people with different needs. </p>
