<em><small>ETHOS Digital Issue 14, December 2025</small></em>

<p>This round of ETHOS Digital Edition continues themes inspired by our recent special print issue commemorating the 10th Anniversary of the SkillsFuture movement. We thank our issue partners, the lead agencies SkillsFuture Singapore and Workforce Singapore, for convening some of these perspectives on this important and evolving national initiative.</p>

<p>In this issue, the <a href="/digital-issue-14/lifelong-learning-sg-supporting-the-skillsfuture-movement/">Lifelong Learning Institute</a> recounts its journey to becoming a hub to realise the SkillsFuture vision of enabling learning and growth for all Singaporeans, revealing plans for its next phase of development.</p>

<p>The <a href="/digital-issue-14/embracing-skills-development-the-employer-s-perspective/">Singapore National Employment Federation (SNEF)</a>, highlights the value of a flexible, collaborative approach to skills mastery and workforce transformation that clarifies win-win outcomes for both employers and employees.</p>

<p>Embodying the SkillsFuture spirit of a skills-first, career health-oriented culture, the Singapore Public Service has introduced a <a href="/digital-issue-14/the-career-fitness-movement/">Career Fitness Movement</a>, with an ecosystem for lifelong career development, supported by clear competency-based frameworks and structures, based on shared responsibility between public officers, their supervisors and their organisations.</p>

<p>Reflecting on continuing education and training, CSC Senior Principal Researcher Dr June Gwee examines <a href="/digital-issue-14/using-case-studies-to-develop-policymaking-competencies-in-continuing-education/">how case studies can be best designed and delivered to develop policymaking competencies</a> among serving public officers.</p>

<p>CSC Principal Researcher Dr James Low documents important strengths underpinning the Public Service’s <a href="/digital-issue-14/crisis-management-in-singapore/">crisis management approach</a> that saw Singapore through the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>In the ETHOS Roundtable, three participants from the <a href="/digital-issue-14/ethos-roundtable-the-trust-imperative/">17th Leadership in Governance Programme</a> share lessons from their recent national experiences on sustaining public trust and engaging the community in an era of misinformation, distraction and contention.</p>

<p>I wish you an insightful read.</p>
