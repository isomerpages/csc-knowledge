<h3>We are entering an age of constraint, where societal demands proliferate
while the resources needed to meet them become less readily available.
This edition of ETHOS on “Rethinking Resourcing in the Public Service”
explores how the public sector needs to regroup and take stock: to
reassess priorities and to consolidate hard-won lessons from a gruelling,
as well as revealing, past few years.</h3><br><br>
