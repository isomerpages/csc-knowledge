<p class="subhead"><span>A</span>ll organisations and teams face    challenges in prioritisation. This is because workload gain, like weight gain, is insidious. It creeps up on us and is hard to get rid of. We rarely seek to add on more of it, but often ﬁnd ourselves inundated nevertheless.</p>

<p>Our instinct when prioritising is to remove activities that take up time. But prioritising work is not about harnessing the willpower to say no to new things. Nor can we expect to start from a blank slate, like how Shopify cancelled meetings (some 322,000 hours’ worth) to free up time for staff members to get things done.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, what we need instead is to spend time and energy deciding what we will do and what we will not do. </p>

<h5>What Prioritisation Is: Focusing on the  Big Small Things </h5>

<p>Prioritisation happens daily, but this is not always tangible to us. The results of how well we prioritise show up as a lagging indicator. Every day, we make choices and incur trade-offs in how we spend our time, energy, and talents, which then also affects others in turn. What can help is to spend our limited time, energy, and talents on the big small things, i.e., the small actions that scale up to a big impact and results.</p>

<p>For example, a senior leader at a management meeting might make it a point to clarify how a new staff idea could contribute tangibly to the agency’s longer-term plans. What might begin as one simple question could prompt other leaders and officers to think more intentionally about the investment of resources for an idea to achieve the agency’s goals. This is what we mean by a “big small thing” that can make a difference in shifting the way teams or organisations think about their work.</p>

<p>Based on insights from the ILOD Transformation Team’s consultancy work with close to 40 public agencies, we have  developed a <b>S.C.A.L.E. Framework</b> as a practical tool to help leaders and organisations prioritise more effectively by focusing on some big small things, along ﬁve key dimensions: Strategy, Culture, Alignment of processes , Leadership, and Empowerment.</p>

	<p>The two questions you need to ask about your <b>Strategy</b>:</p>

		<li>How is our work reﬂecting what our organisation can uniquely do?</li>
