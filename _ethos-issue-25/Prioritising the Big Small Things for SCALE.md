<p class="subhead"><span>A</span>ll organisations and teams face    challenges in prioritisation. This is because workload gain, like weight gain, is insidious. It creeps up on us and is hard to get rid of. We rarely seek to add on more of it, but often ﬁnd ourselves inundated nevertheless.</p>

<p>Our instinct when prioritising is to remove activities that take up time. But prioritising work is not about harnessing the willpower to say no to new things. Nor can we expect to start from a blank slate, like how Shopify cancelled meetings (some 322,000 hours’ worth) to free up time for staff members to get things done.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, what we need instead is to spend time and energy deciding what we will do and what we will not do. </p>

<h5>What Prioritisation Is: Focusing on the  Big Small Things </h5>

<p>Prioritisation happens daily, but this is not always tangible to us. The results of how well we prioritise show up as a lagging indicator. Every day, we make choices and incur trade-offs in how we spend our time, energy, and talents, which then also affects others in turn. What can help is to spend our limited time, energy, and talents on the big small things, i.e., the small actions that scale up to a big impact and results.</p>

<p>For example, a senior leader at a management meeting might make it a point to clarify how a new staff idea could contribute tangibly to the agency’s longer-term plans. What might begin as one simple question could prompt other leaders and officers to think more intentionally about the investment of resources for an idea to achieve the agency’s goals. This is what we mean by a “big small thing” that can make a difference in shifting the way teams or organisations think about their work.</p>

<div class="break">
<p class="break1">" What we need is to spend time and energy 
deciding what we will do and what we will not do."</p>
</div>

<p>Based on insights from the ILOD Transformation Team’s consultancy work with close to 40 public agencies, we have  developed a <b>S.C.A.L.E. Framework</b> as a practical tool to help leaders and organisations prioritise more effectively by focusing on some big small things, along ﬁve key dimensions: Strategy, Culture, Alignment of processes , Leadership, and Empowerment.</p>

<div id="strategy">
<p class="letter-s">Strategy</p>
<b>Clarity for Crafting and Translating into Results</b>

<div class="strategy1">
	<p>The two questions you need to ask about your <b>Strategy</b>:</p>	
<ul>
		<li>How is our work achieving what is core to our organisation?
</li>
		<li>How is our work reﬂecting what our organisation can uniquely do?</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<p>The most important step in prioritisation is to clarify the organisation’s strategy and to activate it in the work done, from the top all the way to the ground. In our consultancy work, we have heard varying degrees of clarity across different levels when officers are asked about their organisation’s focus. We often see organisations spending extensive effort in crafting strategic plans, but less effort in communicating and translating strategies into day-to-day work. </p>

<p>In an engagement session designed  for 76 senior and middle management leaders of an agency, participants discussed how their teams contributed to the strategic pillars of their agency’s transformation. The senior management team had earlier developed the agency’s transformation vision and corresponding strategies. They wanted to take time to share with middle managers, so as to sharpen and translate the strategies for the work on the ground. Energy levels rose as different participants articulated a shared desired impact for their stakeholders and end users. Gathering the leaders for half a day was a big small thing—a small investment of effort that led to signiﬁcant value in alignment. At the end of the session, participants echoed that the time was well spent, particularly with the middle managers articulating greater resonance with organisational strategies in planning and prioritising their work.</p>

<p>When leaders take time to help others understand the core work and unique value created by their organisation, teams and officers will have more clarity in prioritising time and energy for work that matters.</p>

<div id="culture">
	
<p class="letter-c">Culture</p>
<b>Behaviours and Norms We Want More Of</b>

<div class="culture1">
	<p>The two questions you need to ask about your <b>Culture</b>:</p>	
	
<ul>
		<li>How is our culture recognising and rewarding our work outcomes?
</li>
		<li>How is our culture recognising and rewarding the collaboration needed for our work?</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<p>What gets rewarded gets done. An organisation’s culture is built and reinforced day by day through actual work behaviours and norms. Ask any newcomer to observe and share candidly what gets rewarded or frowned upon at the workplace. Their fresh perspectives—free from legacy experiences—offer an outside-in view of current work interactions.</p>

<p>In a conventional workplace, officers are given additional projects beyond their core work in exchange for progress and rewards. While officers can gain exposure and growth opportunities, there is an implied message that one must do more to progress and be rewarded. Taking on ever more work becomes a learned behaviour. Furthermore, we have an intrinsic need to feel competent, which is more easily shown and experienced by doing more.</p>

<div class="break">
<p class="break1">" We have been conditioned for success through adding and not subtracting."</p>
</div>

<p>This runs contrary to the call for prioritisation and reducing workload because we have been conditioned for success through adding and not subtracting. </p>

<p>In ILOD’s interactions with agencies, we have seen some leaders ﬁnd ways to combat such learned behaviours to do more. One leader articulated clear expectations of what was needed for a work deliverable and told officers what ‘done’ work would look like, to reduce unnecessary rework. Another leader clariﬁed with subordinates what good staffing looked like, to prevent overzealous preparations. One leader made the effort to email the entire division, openly lauding an officer who had put up a request to drop work that was no longer relevant. </p>

<p>A few words or a short email can make implicit expectations explicit. These big small things not only have a big impact on officers’ workload and priorities, but can also clarify and encourage the work behaviours and norms we want more of.</p>

<div id="alignment" class="">
<p class="letter-a">ALIGNMENT OF PROCESSES</p>
<b>Jolt for Optimisation</b>

<div class="alignment1">
	<p>The two questions you need to ask about your <b>Alignment of processes:</b></p>	
<ul>
	<li>How have we optimised the layers of clearance and iterations needed for our work?</li>
	<li>How have we optimised virtual and in-person ways of working?</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<p>Work processes can accumulate over time and be hard to get rid of. With the hybrid/ﬂexible work arrangements of the pandemic years, processes may even have multiplied. At the same time, the constraints imposed by the pandemic have also taught us that we can in fact do quite well with less. For example, we learnt that virtual meetings can save on commuting time while not compromising work outcomes.</p>

<p>In a conventional workplace, officers are given additional projects beyond their core work in exchange for progress and rewards. While officers can gain exposure and growth opportunities, there is an implied message that one must do more to progress and be rewarded. Taking on ever more work becomes a learned behaviour. Furthermore, we have an intrinsic need to feel competent, which is more easily shown and experienced by doing more.</p>

<p>One big small thing we can do is to give ourselves an intentional jolt to see if our work processes are indeed adding value. During a leadership team conversation to address high workload, an agency head related his shock of discovering that over 20 iterations had been made to a set of meeting notes that the meeting chairperson did not even see. It could not be clearly determined if each layer added value. The high number of iterations prompted the leaders to discuss how they might have unknowingly contributed to similar inefficiencies. They decided to update the clearance process from a sequential ﬂow to using a shared platform for concurrent clearance by the required parties.</p>

<p>Such a change was a relatively small step for them. But it was a big small thing that led to a shift in mindsets and expectations, prompting a broader relook and optimisation of how they had been working. </p>
