<p class="subhead"><span>T</span>here is much debate globally about how the accumulation of crises—economic, ecological, political and around energy—now amount to a polycrisis. Whether or not they are as connected as some believe, there is no doubting the pressure they are putting on public services across the world. Governments generally responded well to the COVID-19 pandemic, showing great agility. But one legacy of the pandemic is fiscal overstretch—and sharp constraints on resources which make it even harder to respond to the new crises. Meanwhile geopolitical pressures are pushing up spending on defence, which means even less resources available for other purposes.</p>


<p>So can governments adapt, and refashion their shape, processes and cultures to more turbulent times—the times that Xi Jinping often describes as “changes unseen in a century”? </p>

<p>Governing in booms is very different from governing in times of retreat. In this different context, governments need to think and act to use resources carefully while also addressing deep-seated problems. Here, useful ideas can be drawn from ecology, which has introduced many to the idea that policies of reduction—whether reducing energy and materials use, waste or carbon emissions—can be as important as policies for growth.</p>	
	
<p>I propose three areas in which new methods are needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to mobilise intelligence more systematically, i.e., data, evidence and knowledge of all kinds, to ensure that action is focused, targeted and smart. Experiences from the pandemic can be applied to other fields but will require different structures and processes to be effective.</li>
<li>Some overdue reforms to public finance are needed to better fit the demands of the 21st century, including using investment methods f o r h uma n s e r v i c e s s u c h a s education, health and innovation, and better use of data to connect inputs of money to outputs and outcomes.</li>
<li>We need a framework for thinking creatively about how to achieve economies within public services: going beyond the standard tools of cuts, trimming and delay to more creative options for restructuring services and changing the contract with citizens.</li>
</ol>
