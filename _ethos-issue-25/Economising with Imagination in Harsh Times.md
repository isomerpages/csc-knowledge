<p class="subhead"><span>T</span>here is much debate globally about how the accumulation of crises—economic, ecological, political and around energy—now amount to a polycrisis. Whether or not they are as connected as some believe, there is no doubting the pressure they are putting on public services across the world. Governments generally responded well to the COVID-19 pandemic, showing great agility. But one legacy of the pandemic is fiscal overstretch—and sharp constraints on resources which make it even harder to respond to the new crises. Meanwhile geopolitical pressures are pushing up spending on defence, which means even less resources available for other purposes.</p>


<p>So can governments adapt, and refashion their shape, processes and cultures to more turbulent times—the times that Xi Jinping often describes as “changes unseen in a century”? </p>

<p>Governing in booms is very different from governing in times of retreat. In this different context, governments need to think and act to use resources carefully while also addressing deep-seated problems. Here, useful ideas can be drawn from ecology, which has introduced many to the idea that policies of reduction—whether reducing energy and materials use, waste or carbon emissions—can be as important as policies for growth.</p>	
	
<p>I propose three areas in which new methods are needed:</p>
<ol>
	<li>We need to mobilise <b>intelligence</b> more systematically, i.e., data, evidence and knowledge of all kinds, to ensure that action is focused, targeted and smart. Experiences from the pandemic can be applied to other fields but will require different structures and processes to be effective.</li>
	<li>Some overdue <b>reforms</b> to public finance are needed to better fit the demands of the 21st century, including using investment methods for human services such as education, health and innovation, and better use of data to connect inputs of money to outputs and outcomes.</li>
	<li>We need a framework for thinking creatively about how to achieve <b>economies</b> within public services: going beyond the standard tools of cuts, trimming and delay to more creative options for restructuring services and changing the contract with citizens.</li>
</ol>	

<h5>INTELLIGENCE AS A CORE TASK OF GOVERNMENT</h5>
<p>Governments have always relied on intelligence to do their work. But whereas in the past this was thought about primarily in relation to enemies and threats, espionage and war, they now need to think systematically about intelligence in relation to everyday tasks, from transport to healthcare, welfare to education</p>

<p>This became very apparent during the pandemic. As I showed in a recent study of how governments—and the societies around them—mobilised intelligence to handle the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, the last few years brought an explosion of innovation in new ways to organise intelligence.  The pandemic was an unprecedented event in its global impacts and in the scale of government responses and required a myriad of policy decisions: about testing, lockdowns, masks, school closures, visiting rules at care homes and vaccinations. All of these depended on inputs of intelligence including data, evidence, models, tacit knowledge, foresight, and creativity and innovation.</p>

<p>But governments varied greatly in their ability to organise these well. Governments needed health as well as non-health data to help understand how the virus was spreading in real time and its impacts.</p>

<p>They needed models—for example, to judge if their hospitals were at risk of being overrun. They needed evidence—for example, on whether enforcing mask-wearing would be effective. And they needed to tap into the knowledge of citizens and frontline staff quickly to spot potential problems and frictions.</p>
