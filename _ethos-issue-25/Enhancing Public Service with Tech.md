<h5>Transforming the Work of the Public Sector in an Age of Scarce Resources
</h5>

<p>Due to various headwinds in the world today, resourcing has become an increasingly pertinent concern in the tech space, and the public sector has not been spared. GovTech, through the Digital Government Blueprint,1 is making a difference by helping to realise Singapore’s public sector transformation, particularly in three broad areas: the Future of Work, our Future Workforce, and our Future Workplace.</p>

<p>Due to various headwinds in the world today, resourcing has become an increasingly pertinent concern in the tech space, and the public sector has not been spared. GovTech, through the Digital Government Blueprint,1 is making a difference by helping to realise Singapore’s public sector transformation, particularly in three broad areas: the Future of Work, our Future Workforce, and our Future Workplace.</p>

<p>These changes have implications for our Future Workforce. We need to determine the skills which will be relevant to our public officers in the future. It is important to upskill and reskill our public officers, uplifting their digital competencies such as how to make the best use of data and technology tools, as well as cybersecurity. Training aside, it is also about attracting and retaining talent for the public sector. In the past year, we have seen the tech sector slow down their hiring and letting their workers go because of over-hiring during the pandemic. This period of industry correction has provided an opportunity for our public sector to bring in quality digital talent.</p>

<p>With the pandemic unlocking hybrid modes of working and flexible work arrangements, we must explore how to enable more productive, ﬂexible and joyful Future Workplaces. How can we leverage digital technology to improve these new modes of working, enhance collaboration, and at the same time, maintain engagement with our public officers, as well as monitor their health and mental wellbeing? How should team leaders manage their workplaces differently in this new context?</p>


<h5>Realising Digital Transformation</h5>
<p>The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG), which includes GovTech, typically looks at three sets of stakeholders: citizens, businesses, and the Public Service. As Director of GovTech’s Digital Workplace, my purview is the stakeholder group comprising public officers. Our Future Workplace is one of my key themes of focus, but I also look at the Future of Work and how our public officers can leverage more data, as well as upskilling and other aspects of building up the future public sector workforce that we need.</p>

<p>The work we do goes beyond just  gadgets and technology—it also addresses the psychological and cultural aspects of work. For example, team cohesion is an important element of work. After putting in place the technology to let our people connect and work remotely, we need to think about how to enable more seamless interaction and engagement. For example, after providing connectivity tools such as Zoom and SG-Teams, we want to support communities of practice, so we have technologies like Workplace from Meta, to help colleagues come together and share ideas and best practices to help each other level up on areas they may not be strong in. But having technology is one thing—people must also be willing to use the technology. Officers may have webcams, but they may not turn them on during online sessions. Getting people to turn on their webcams is not a technology issue; it’s a cultural one. So, one of our key priorities is the non-tech side of work.</p>

<p>Through various surveys, we know that many public officers have been saying that being provided with and given tech training is one thing, but it is quite another to see it used in the workplace. For instance, do supervisors and leaders model tech adoption? One of the initiatives we have set up to address this is a Government to Employee (G2E) Change Network. We have gathered around 1,400 Change Champions across different roles in the public sector, including some who are in</p>
