<p>The Singapore Government’s budgeting framework continually evolves to meet the needs of our people and the challenges of our national context. We have matured, from a traditional bottom-up system based on detailed line items (Budget 1.0) and programme budgets (Budget 2.0), to a system which emphasises robust aggregate limits on spending while providing line ministries with maximum discretion to make ﬁnal allocations among their various programmes (Budget 3.0). While Budget 3.0 is still relevant and important for our ﬁscal management, signiﬁcant changes in our operating environment have prompted further improvements to our budgeting framework.</p>

<p>Expenditure on government policies has been increasing signiﬁcantly with time: from 15.0% of GDP in FY2006–2010 to 18.1% of GDP in FY2016–2020. This has been funded sustainably through increasing taxes and a Net Investment Returns spending framework that strikes a fair balance between the interests of today and tomorrow. However, we anticipate pressures for public expenditure to continue rising. Geopolitical uncertainty and lessons learnt from the COVID pandemic will increase the size of government and expenditure on resilience. Our ageing population and slowing resident labour force growth will limit the amount of revenues we collect, while requiring greater expenditure on healthcare and social security. In the longer term, economic growth is expected to plateau, further limiting revenue growth.</p>
