<p class="subhead"><span>W</span>e are moving into quite a different future. The external environment has changed.</p>

<p>Domestically, we have a mature population with new needs but also more questions about how things are done. At the same time, we know we need to use resources more sustainably. Public Service manpower growth cannot outpace that of the broader labour force when our population is not growing and the labour force is stagnating. This is the reality we must grapple with. 
</p>

<p>In my view, it is a privilege to have these demands placed on 
us, because it means that Singaporeans trust us to deliver and they look to us for solutions. This is a better position to be in than one in which the public does not trust government and has given up on it being able to solve problems, which is happening in some countries. But it does mean that we have to prioritise and approach our work differently.</p>

<p>Coming out of the pandemic, we see the cumulative strain that public officers have borne over the past few years: they feel overworked, and their engagement is dipping. This is in part because we have very committed public officers who want to do their best and go the extra mile, but as a result, they have given a lot of themselves and feel exhausted.</p>

<p>It is important to recognise this burnout, and therefore ﬁnd ways to refocus our public service workload on what really matters, in the face of many competing demands. We want to emphasise the areas of work that bring joy to our officers and reinforce the satisfaction they feel when they improve lives. At the same time, we should reduce the pain points that public officers face, such as the internal bureaucracy that comes with any mature, complex organisation.</p>

<p>If anything, COVID-19 has reaffirmed the value of good governance and the importance of the Public Service. This is why we need to continue to keep officers engaged in the Service and staying well.</p>

<h5>Creating More Purposeful Work</h5>
<p>In 2022, we launched a movement to manage work. We initially calledit the “Reduction Movement” but are deciding on a different phrase because it is not just about reducing unnecessary work, but also about uplifting the joys of work, emphasising purpose, and making a much bigger commitment through words and deeds to the development, progression and learning of all our officers. 
</p>

<p>It is vital that the Public Service delivers on the promises of this movement, in tangible and intangible ways. We must demonstrate our commitment to our officers’ wellbeing: that we do not take them for granted, even as we affirm our sense of shared mission as a Public Service.</p>

<p>We must ensure that we are changing the way we work, reducing internal red tape and so on. It must happen on the ground in a way officers can experience.</p>

<p>As Permanent Secretary, my duty to my colleagues is to make sure that our Ministry reviews all our processes and we understand the user journeys, to know what our officers are going through, so that we can make the right decisions on how to streamline and what to get rid of.</p>


<p>But any officer should also feel it is within their power to figure out the best way to do this. They know where the pain points are, be it travel claims or procurement processes, or clearance and reporting lines in their agencies.</p>

<p>I’d like to encourage all officers to embrace this sense of agency in raising these issues to supervisors, suggesting alternatives to achieve the intended outcomes, and then working together to make them happen. If we can get officers to work alongside supervisors to streamline work, with leaders prepared to make executive decisions to change processes, we will go a long way.</p>

things better.</p>
