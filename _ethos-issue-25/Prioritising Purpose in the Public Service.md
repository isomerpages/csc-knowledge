<p class="subhead"><span>W</span>e are moving into quite a different future. The external environment has changed.</p>

<p>Domestically, we have a mature population with new needs but also more questions about how things are done. At the same time, we know we need to use resources more sustainably. Public Service manpower growth cannot outpace that of the broader labour force when our population is not growing and the labour force is stagnating. This is the reality we must grapple with. 
</p>

<p>In my view, it is a privilege to have these demands placed on 
us, because it means that Singaporeans trust us to deliver and they look to us for solutions. This is a better position to be in than one in which the public does not trust government and has given up on it being able to solve problems, which is happening in some countries. But it does mean that we have to prioritise and approach our work differently.</p>

<p>Coming out of the pandemic, we see the cumulative strain that public officers have borne over the past few years: they feel overworked, and their engagement is dipping. This is in part because we have very committed public officers who want to do their best and go the extra mile, but as a result, they have given a lot of themselves and feel exhausted.</p>

<p>It is important to recognise this burnout, and therefore ﬁnd ways to refocus our public service workload on what really matters, in the face of many competing demands. We want to emphasise the areas of work that bring joy to our officers and reinforce the satisfaction they feel when they improve lives. At the same time, we should reduce the pain points that public officers face, such as the internal bureaucracy that comes with any mature, complex organisation.</p>
