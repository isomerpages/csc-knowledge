<h5>A Shift in Public Discourse</h5>

<p>Over the past few years, there has been a signiﬁcant shift in the global public conversation. In Europe, this was the outcome of several crises: there was the COVID-19 pandemic and its shock to supply chains, but there were also massive ﬂoods, and massive heatwaves that have even caused a collapse in the electric grid in some large cities. There was COP26, that raised dire warnings about potential damage and loss from climate impacts. And then there was the Russian invasion of Ukraine and all its implications (including its energy implications), and a growing unease with relying on China.</p>

<p>There has been a change in the master frame, from a debate about balancing growth with sustainability, to a perspective in which every issue must be seen through the prism of a now tripartite trade-off between growth, sustainability <u>and security.</u></p>

<p>It is not just that there is new awareness about the drivers of change, but also that the rate of change is accelerating. It turns out that climate change is speeding up, just like media and technology is, and along with it related challenges such as chronic disease, an ageing population and so on. In this new light, it is no longer enough to tweak policy and tinker at the edges to address issues. Increasingly, a whole-of-society approach is needed to address the challenges that confront us. It is not just good to have everyone on board now: it’s a necessity.</p>

<p>This suggests that we will also need a different kind of language and vocabulary for public discourse. I was part of the UK think tank that came up with the concept of co-creation and co-production in the past, but that was from an old era of affluence and choice. We were inviting people to co-produce their own health outcomes or take ownership of their own diets and so on. There was</p>

<div class="break">
<p class="break1">"Increasingly, a whole-of-society approach is needed to address the challenges that confront us."</p>
</div>

<div class="break">
<p class="break1">"Now we are in a situation where we need to appeal explicitly to people’s sense of responsibility, in an era that is more characterised by necessity and emergency."</p>
</div>

<p>something empowering about this approach. But we are no longer in the same world. Now we are in a situation where we need to appeal explicitly to people’s sense of responsibility, in an era that is more characterised by necessity and emergency. You wouldn’t talk about 'co-creating' a war effort, for instance. This is about sacrifice in some ways. But I think people can rise to this challenge if they are asked  to play a part for something bigger than themselves. </p>


<p>This could also be aspirational: in Singapore, it could be about reframing the story so that Singaporeans are called to contribute their particular expertise not just to the country but also to a changing world, to help solve humanity’s challenges for the future.</p>


<h5>Strengthening Public Participation</h5>

<p>This is work that needs to be carried out across society. In this regard, the most important thing that governments can do is to share expertise—and in fact expertise can be co-created! Raising awareness is important, but it needs to be rooted in understanding, in facts, and so on. It is not enough for expertise to be held by governments or civil servants: and it is not enough for it to be shared out, so that public deliberation is well-informed. That’s a ﬁrst step.  But it needs to go further: the public needs to be involved in creating and elaborating that expertise. This is what will make its use legitimate and less questioned.</p>

<p>Deliberation is going to be crucial, because people need to understand how things work when they are asked to make and also accept decisions: even minor or local ones. This is how we help bridge the gap and ﬁght fake news: by not just sharing information, but also having discussions and involving people. Just like you don’t learn how to drive a car only by reading the manual but by getting behind the wheel, so citizens need experience in being involved in civic issues and making decisions.</p>


<div class="break">
<p class="break1">"Public participation is a muscle. People need to be asked to exercise it regularly, and this needs to be a fact of life"</p>
</div>

<p>You see this in participatory budgeting, where people realise that even in the best case, you only get to play around with about 4% of the total national budget: the rest of it has already been allocated to education, health, housing and so on. And that’s one of the first lessons: to realise how little leeway policymakers have to make these discretionary decisions. To learn how to take responsibility, citizens need to walk a little in decision-makers’  shoes, both to feel empowered, but also to realise what the real constraints are. For instance, as pension reform triggers protests around France, it is striking how little people understand about the constraints on public spending in the future.</p>

<p>Beyond sharing information and more inclusive involvement, public deliberation also needs to be granted time to be effective and powerful. Peter Macleod, who runs a deliberation design studio called MASS LBP,1 based in Toronto, argues that people should see civic deliberation, public consultation and public decision-making like jury duty or national service—something that they will be called upon a few times in life to do to play their part in their community. Public participation is a muscle. People need to be asked to exercise it regularly, and this needs to be a fact of life.</p>

<p>An important aspect of public participation is to move from what we have collectively thought of as a one-way street government engaging with citizens—to citizens engaging the other way as well. But just as crucial is to nurture and mediate citizen-to-citizen conversations. While it is important for institutions to open up and be more inclusive, what’s also important is for people to talk to each other. This is necessary for people to think about what they want, to realise others have different priorities, and to be able to disagree and so on. Those conversations with each other (not just with those in power) are the basis of civic life.</p>

<p>This process also requires stewardship. The public sector needs to work with civil society, but you also need to make sure that you create the spaces in which these conversations can take place, and that you have, for instance, an educational curriculum that cultivates this in the classroom. Instead of just shoving information into young people’s heads, they also need to be able to use their time to talk to one another —and again, to learn to appreciate differences of opinion, of preferences, of perspectives.  It is one of Canada’s great achievements that it has managed to make diversity of views something that Canadians collectively value. This is the basic principle of an open society.</p>

<p>If we want public goodwill, then we have to have ways in which the public can actually develop itself as a public with goodwill. When it comes to collective decision-making, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. All the research shows that people will tend to go along with decisions they may not agree with, but that they know have been arrived at in a fair way, especially if they have been part of the process, even if they disagree with the outcome. While some might be sore losers, most people accept that they may lose today but they might win tomorrow if they have another go. This is why it is so important that the government is involved in this and receptive to the method, because you have to make sure that people have lots of goes at it. And of course, that they are not always on the losing side.</p>

<h5>From Exclusive Competence to Inclusive Learning</h5>

<p>One of the hardest things for civil servants—particularly in places like Singapore where there has been a tradition of government competence— is being ready to admit that you don't have all the answers.  And it is made particularly difficult in contemporary societies in which through forensic  </p>

<p class="narain1">"We cannot just deliver public goods in a manner that would exhaust everything, leaving nothing for future generations"</p>
</div>

<p><span class="author1-1">BORA:</span> Be it geopolitical conflict, climate change, or the economic value chain, the global view has now changed. During the COVID crisis, I was in Cambodia trying to get food to our people. The experience made us realise how vulnerable it is to always rely on global resources for our own needs and wellbeing. Having headed the coordination of one of the major side events for the Asia–Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit, I see that in a volatile global economy, many countries believe that there needs to be a greater push for regional onshoring of certain trades. You must make sure that you have access to the resources—either within or close to your borders, to produce enough for yourself, be it food or other needs—rather than depend on countries far away.</p>

<p>So, while there is still a push for multilateralism, there is also the challenge of making sure a country is self-reliant to some extent. While this may be more difficult for a country like Singapore, we also see it taking this approach, for instance in its water desalination efforts.</p>

<p><span class="author2-2">CHOWDHOURY:</span> For Bangladesh, the constraint is that even if we can meet the basic food needs of our 170 million people domestically, we cannot make up for it in terms of nutritional value: we can produce all the rice we want, but we still need to ﬁnd sources of protein and other nutrients from elsewhere. As societies develop more complex consumer bases, they also begin to demand more complex ingredients, such as cooking oils which they can’t always produce themselves.</p>

<p>So as much as we should consider a certain degree of self-reliance, we also need to accept and carefully manage the risks of trade. When it comes to multilateral trade, we see that relationships can change, and then where do you go? You need to have several options open, rather than be reliant on only one source, say of your energy or food supply.</p>

<h5>What lessons have you drawn from the COVID-19 pandemic on supporting 
innovation and growth while promoting the prudent use of limited resources?</h5>
</div>	

<p><span class="author3-3">NARAIN:</span> The COVID pandemic opened our eyes, but sadly it seems we may have closed them again. During the pandemic, everyone was encouraged to plant vegetables at home, which was a good thing. But once things returned to normal, we stopped doing it and we went back to consuming imported food. The same applies to wo r k i n g f rom home, which reduced pollution and use of petrol. It would have been good to integrate these pra c tices into our development processes and daily habits, to help our people make better use of resources.</p>
	
<p>Some of these pandemic-era practices can help us better manage our resources, our time, and our health—even when we are not living in pandemic mode.</p>

<div class="narain">
<p class="narain1">"Some pandemic-era practices can help us better manage our resources, our time and our health."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="author2-2">CHOWDHOURY:</span> There are lessons from COVID that can be integrated in the post-COVID world. In resource-poor Bangladesh, even running schools is a major challenge: even under normal circumstances, we don’t have enough Science and Math teachers to attend to our millions of students. What COVID has taught us are new ways of educating students, using technologies such as free-to-air broadcasting, or online teaching and learning.</p>

<p>In the past, we had the infrastructure to do this, but not the mindset to adopt these methods. Now we are developing a blended education policy to formalise some of these approaches. They will help us bridge the last mile in education—I cannot send specialised teachers to every village in the outskirts, but I can provide these audio-visual resources, with local teachers as a guide, and still improve learning outcomes for more students.</p>

<p><span class="author1-1">BORA:</span> The pandemic was a wake- up call for Cambodia. Our thriving garment export industry, which we relied on economically, dried up when the global value chain was disrupted. At the same time, the agricultural sector blossomed. We realised not only did we need domestic produce to feed our people, but that we had the entire food chain and nutrient mix within our own country.</p>

<p>So there has been a renewed effort to push our agriculture industry forward. We already produce foods, such as rice, which are exported to other countries to be repackaged as their products. If we improve our own processing and packaging capabilities to meet international standards, we can make them our own products to export.</p>

<p>Without a crisis like the pandemic, we would still be looking to manufacturing industries and attracting foreign investments to those sectors to create jobs. But now we are pushing our own private sector to play a larger role in creating jobs for their fellow  Cambodians. Of course, we are still going to have manufacturing, but now, apart from having international ﬁrms come to produce goods that are sold under their own brands, we also want to produce Cambodian products for the world.</p>

<p><span class="author2-2">CHOWDHOURY:</span> Self-sufficiency is the agenda in many governments. The public sector can frame policy or set the goals, say to produce our own goods, but in our experience, that alone has not worked. In Bangladesh, we needed the dynamism of the private sector—the sectors that grew our economy were not on our public sector’s policy agenda.</p>

<div class="chow">
<p class="chow1">"The mindset change is to shift from ruling to serving-not to run everything from the centre."</p>
</div>

<p>Now, once the private sector takes up these growth sectors, the public sector can catch up with it, and resolve issues as they come along, such as reducing red tape. What we in the public sector need to understand is that innovation and enterprise are going to come from private initiatives, and we must try to assist them rather than try and do it by ourselves. Instead, we should focus on key areas of national importance, such as food security, and leave value-adding to private enterprise.</p>

<p>Having come from the private sector into the public sector, I see an enormous disconnect. The public sector mentality is that we know, we will ﬁx, we will do. Whereas the private sector thinks: you don't know very much, you are only catching up.</p>

<p>So, I see the public sector’s role as assisting, not taking on, the job of growth. The mindset change is to shift from ruling to serving—not to run everything from the centre up to the last mile, which was the mindset of the colonial government in South Asia.</p>

<p><span class="author3-3">NARAIN:</span> I agree, but we also need State regulation—in a benevolent manner to ensure fair play, not for the sake of imposing obstacles.</p>

<p>We need to ensure that regulation by the State is conducted in a dispassionate, objective manner, as it is in Singapore, according to set prescribed criteria. The public sector has to allow the private sector to provide services subject to appropriate regulation, and transparent and prescribed criteria.</p>

<p><span class="author1-1">BORA:</span> Whether to regulate or let things happen is an ongoing debate, and it is not a clear-cut issue. Some things are just going to come whether or not we chase after it, such as blockchain or e-commerce.</p>


<div class="bora">
<p class="bora1">"Public policy, can bring attention to a sector that warrants it. The private sector also needs a wake-up call because they can get too comfortable"</p>
</div>

<p>But in other cases, such as agriculture, public policy can bring attention to a sector that warrants it. The private sector may also need a wake-up call because they can get too comfortable with making money in a conventional way, and not innovate or diversify. Sometimes it is just to remind them that there are things going on outside of their routine. I do believe the public sector needs to have a certain amount of forward thinking or foresight in its policies and regulation to do this well.</p>


<div class="wake">
<h5>From your time at the Leaders in Governance Programme (LGP), is there 
anything else that you have observed to be useful or interesting? What would you 
like your counterparts in the Singapore public sector to consider for the future?</h5>
</div>	

<p><span class="author1-1">BORA:</span>The leaders we met in our time in Singapore were all very personable—there seems to be a shift in leadership style and approach to policymaking away from the top-down mentality, and it bodes well for the future.</p>

<p>When I heard that Singapore is putting more efforts into scholarships and grooming as part of its succession planning and public sector development, it affected me, as a late bloomer myself. I grew up bullied in school, which made it difficult for me to perform. Luckily, I had a chance to get more opportunities to demonstrate my leadership skills and to shine later in life.</p>

<p>I feel there could be initiatives to support those who may be struggling in school because they are shy or not as social, and so may take more time to bloom. People learn in different ways and respond to different kinds of teaching. They should not be overlooked or left behind.</p>

<p>I believe this would also help the government better relate to young people.</p>

<p><span class="author3-3">NARAIN:</span>Constant monitoring, assessment and streamlining are all  very good for efficiency, but I wonder what effects this can have on, for example, mental health. In Singapore, we have always been meeting leaders who are high-performing—who went to Stanford and got First Class at Cambridge and so on. What about those who are mid-range, not even lowest of the class? Those who are striving to keep up with the pack? </p>

<p>In my work with the CEDAW (UN Convention on the Elimination of D i s c r imi nat i on aga i n st Women )Committee, we have reviewed so-called developed countries which are often much vaunted internationally, and score highly on happiness indices and so on, but when we review the data, we ﬁnd that some of their policies can have an adverse impact on citizens’ mental health. Because everyone has to conform to this model of being good, healthy, and perfect, those who are not as good may have mental health issues, and this is an aspect which many of us do not see and to which I would respectfully draw the attention of my Singaporean counterparts.</p>

<p><span class="author2-2">CHOWDHOURY:</span> Quantification
is a tough challenge. Traditionally, we understand economics in terms of consumption and p roduc tion and therefore there is a financial  quantiﬁcation of what is growth, what is wellbeing.But what about deﬁning, redeﬁning welfare, or happiness in non-ﬁnancial terms? For instance, might we learn to be happy without being a conformist individual chasing after material aspirations and being in an elite talent pool?</p>

<p>I see that there is a tendency to celebrate consumerism, which is contributing to a lot of issues, from mental health to environmental degradation. It is not sustainable.</p>

<div class="chow">
<p class="chow1">"What could Singapore do as a more enlightened society to contribute to humanism rather than to hyper-consumerism"</p>
</div>

<p>Could governments make an effort to sensitise their population on humanism, on charity, on volunteerism? For instance, every citizen in Singapore has wealth and skills that could be shared with the region and with the rest of the world. In this age of the shared economy, instead of having a mentality of always wanting to be the best or having the most, this could broaden the appeal of Singapore beyond being just a place of wealth. What could Singapore do as a more enlightened society to contribute to humanism rather than to hyper-consumerism?</p>

<p>And what about doing something completely different to increase the welfare, mental health, happiness, or aesthetic values of individuals? These questions do not show up in policy discussions at all, or at least not until the pandemic. We should continue to think about these issues.</p>
