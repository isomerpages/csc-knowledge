<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>The Government Outcomes Lab is a research programme based at Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government.1 It started in 2016 as a partnership between the UK Government and the University of Oxford, to look at ways to tackle complex social and environmental issues by working collaboratively across sectors. In today’s hybrid environment, public services are no longer just delivered by the public sector. Instead, we now see a multiplicity of actors, including the private sector, impact investors, non-profit organisations, voluntary groups and social enterprises. This is enriching, but also challenging: how do you bring them together to work effectively towards shared goals?</p>


<p>When the GO Lab was set up, the UK Government was about to launch a very large programme called the Life  Chances Fund. This was aimed at exploring how a particular instrument—social impact bonds—could contribute to the portfolio of what government was doing. At the time, the evidence about the effectiveness of such instruments was still very weak. Since then, we have been working alongside government to investigate this, gathering evidence from all over the world on these instruments and how they work.</p>

<p>This means the government’s share of GDP is expected to rise. In the private sector, you’re paying for these better services. But in the public sector, there’s a limit to how much you can meet these higher expectations purely through tax-based public funding. In countries like the UK, for instance, it’s taboo to even think about market pricing for healthcare services because of perceived inequalities in affordability.</p>

<p>So, increasing demands on the public sector are not going to go away, but there is a limit to how much public funds we can raise through taxation. The question is how we are going to manage both the demand for and supply of government services. We will have to get much more efficient in what we do and ﬁnd better ways of doing the same things, because we cannot just keep throwing money at problems.</p>


<p>In the beginning, the government wanted to know if social impact bonds "work".  Over time, we unpacked this question—a social impact bond may or may not work, in the same way a simple grant may or may not work. So the question is more about the circumstances under which instruments like social impact bonds are more likely to be effective. We have found that there is no one model: the term "social impact bond" or "social impact partnership" is in fact an umbrella term that includes very many practices and types of agreements between  the public sector and other sectors, including impact investors and those from the non-proﬁt world.</p>

<p>The core idea is what we call an outcome-based approach: we come to an agreement for the provision of a particular activity or service, but we will pay only when a certain level of predeﬁned outcomes has been  achieved. A social impact bond is thus a kind of outcome-based ﬁnancing model based on the presence of an impact investor who is willing to provide the upfront capital to provide the service, which will only be paid ex-post, and only if outcomes have been delivered.</p>

<div class="break">
<p class="break1">"Outcome-based approaches are most successfully deployed as part of attempts to do things differently because the status quo has not  
been satisfactory."</p>
</div>

<p>The idea is that the impact investor will bear the risk in case the pre-agreed outcomes have not been achieved. Given the resource constraints of the public sector, outcome-based contracting is hence, potentially, a good way to make more efficient use of resources, because the government only has to pay when it works. If a programme is successful, and governments pay for the achieved outcomes, the originally invested capital could even be reinvested in the same  or other programmes.</p>

<p>In my view, having looked at these approaches for several years, outcome-based approaches are most successfully deployed as part of attempts to do things differently because the status quo has not been satisfactory. However, it can be tricky to distinguish between whether a programme has worked because of  a particular intervention, or the governance arrangement (i.e., the outcome-based approach) under which it was implemented. Sometimes, what works is the combination and interaction of the two.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in our research, we have found that outcome-based contracts tend to be most effective when designed and used intentionally to improve collaboration, prevention or innovation.</p>


<h5>Three Logics of  Outcome-Based Contracting</h5>
<br>
<div class="title">
<h5><span class="num">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logic of Collaboration</h5>
</div>
	
<p>With complex social issues, there is often fragmentation: a person who is homeless, for instance, requires support from several different services. They may have a problem with ﬁnding a job, with the housing they have, alongside problems of substance abuse and mental health or family issues. </p>

<p>No single agency can offer support in all these dimensions. Typically, what happens is that there are separate contracts: one to support housing, a separate one to support employment, and yet another to support mental health. And the person who needs these has to report to separate agencies and retell their story; the respective service providers don’t collaborate.</p>

<p>Here, an outcome-based approach seems to be promising because it is not premised on who delivers what service or how it is organised: what you want to see is the outcome, which is a person finding their way out of an unsustainable situation. Usually, an organisation emerges as the main contractual counterpart who works with a portfolio of other organisations offering different services. Often, a link worker, who knows the individual client’s situation and needs, then offers wraparound care, guiding them through the different services, making the connections and offering a holistic package that makes sense for the person needing help.</p>

<p>An outcome-based contract makes this arrangement easier to operate, because you have one coordinating organisation responsible for the overall outcome, with the freedom to organise personalised packages of different services to make an overall difference.</p>

<br>
<div class="title">
<h5><span class="num">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logic of Prevention</h5>
</div>

<p>The public sector is often ﬁreﬁghting and having to intervene in one crisis after another. With greater demand for public services and increasingly constrained resources, the pressure is to cut provision in some areas. The investments that bring beneﬁts only in the longer term, such as preventative services, are often the ones that get dropped ﬁrst.</p>

<p>This is where an outcome-based approach with a logic of prevention has been promising. A programme might have access to funds to help reduce the number of ﬁres that need to be fought in future—and this pays back the investment that is made at the beginning, through cost savings. Outcomes to prevent long-term unemployment reduce demand for support services down the road.</p>

<p>In such projects, you can have a case history and track record to see where trends are going, allowing you to make an informed guess on whether the intervention has made a difference in changing the trend and reducing the cost of the service. The cost savings can then be shared between the public sector and those who have made it happen.</p>


<br>
<div class="title">
<h5><span class="num">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logic of Innovation</h5>
</div>

<p>The public sector is often considered conservative, risk averse, and not particularly innovative. We tend to see interventions being delivered over and over, without checking if they actually work. Doing the same thing avoids blame, compared to trying something courageous and new where something might go wrong.</p>

<p>An outcome-based approach with a view to trying things out could help break through this risk-averse culture, by allowing discretionary space for organisations to try something new that hasn’t been done before, particularly when the status quo is not working.</p>

<p>Even if the logics are clear and in place, there are many different ways to carry out outcome-based contracts. Outcome-based approaches are complex instruments. Not all projects will succeed. Transaction costs can be high, and without clarity of intention and commitment, people can lose patience and then little benefit is gained afterwards. We see that these instruments have been most effective when they are used to adapt, change and build relationships in the field, in order to create a working ecosystem and a learning culture.</p>

<div class="break">
<p class="break1">"Outcome-based approaches are complex instruments. Not all projects will succeed."</p>
</div>


<h5>Giving Outcome-Based Approaches the Best Chance to Work</h5>
<br>
<div class="title1">
<h5>Clarify Intentions and End Goals
</h5>
</div>

<p>It is important to clarify what one is trying to achieve through the outcome-based intervention, so that it can be carried out more intentionally, and evaluated appropriately. An important priority is thinking about the exit strategy: what happens at the end of the project. We have found this to be a revealing and provocative question in practice. </p>

<p>Do you want to trial an intervention to deploy elsewhere once if the project ends, even outside an outcome-based programme? Or do you want to explore ways to better collaborate with partners? Or your goal might be prevention, in which case you might want to keep issuing similar contracts if they work by continuing to access patient capital. Once you know what you are really after, you can work backwards to set up an appropriate way to design and also evaluate the programme.</p>

<p>Asking people to look forward to the future also obliges them to think about why they are embarking on this project. It prompts them to be more mission- and purpose-driven, and helps bring out the motivation of why people started on this work in the ﬁrst place. </p>

<br>
<div class="title1">
<h5>Active Performance Management
</h5>
</div>

<p>Much goes on during the delivery of a service that can make a difference to whether an intervention works. In typical public sector procurement, most attention is paid to a contract before it is issued, but afterwards little is paid to the job until the contract is due to be renewed. However, when an impact investor is involved in an outcome-based contract, they have a stake in making sure the project succeeds: otherwise, they lose their capital. 
</p>

<p>A good investor, typically in close collaboration with the other stakeholders involved in the programme, will practise active performance management: they will come to the table to check that things are on track, and that the outcomes are being delivered as intended. While there are transaction costs to meetings and handholding, there could be benefits from this hands-on approach that outweigh the additional cost as delivery problems can be tackled promptly.</p>

<br>
<div class="title1">
<h5>Evaluate Outcomes Thoughtfully</h5>
</div>

<p>How impact is measured in outcome-based contracts is crucial. Metrics and performance indicators are meant to be proxies for what the outcomes are, but they exist on a continuum and not all of them will be directly indicative of the outcome. While it is rare for payment in outcome-based contracts to be 100% based on purely outcome-driven indicators, how these proxy measures are used seems to make a difference to the success of a project. They shape the motivation and focus of the contracted organisation.</p>

<p>In one example we have seen, two organisations were given the same contract to tackle homelessness in the UK. One used the outcome-based approach to motivate staff to do things differently, and to redefine what good looked like. The other organisation, which was smaller and more dependent on the contract’s paid value, put emphasis on meeting targets. The metrics were the same, but the way they were used to manage staff was different. In one organisation, the emphasis was on learning how to achieve outcomes. In the other, staff seemed more pressured to deliver </p>

<div class="break">
<p class="break1">"Organisations that are willing to work in a relational fashion seem to make the best use of flexible contractual arrangements. "</p>
</div>

<p>on targets and demotivated. The same contract was deployed by one organisation to build a culture of learning and to focus on the long term, while the other used it transactionally. This experience teaches us that contractual clauses and technical features of these instruments are only half of the story.</p>


<br>
<div class="title1">
<h5>Relationships of Trust</h5>
</div>

<p>Organisations that are purpose-driven and that are willing to work in a relational fashion seem to make the best use of ﬂexible contractual arrangements. 
</p>

<p>The basic theory of transaction cost economics suggests that if you can specify everything in a task, you can contract it out, but if it is too complex and you cannot, you need to do it in-house. But the world is not so black-and-white. What do you do with elements you cannot specify in a contract? If the counterpart is someone you can trust, the contract works better—but how then do you select a trustworthy partner? </p>

<p>In places like Japan, there are traditional long-term relationships between organisations and between the public and private sectors that liberal economic ideology might traditionally have considered suboptimal. But new forms of relational contracting are now becoming more common, because ﬁnding a good supplier is very costly. Private sector ﬁrms are now attempting to nurture a meaningful, open long-term relationship with counterparts, and not only stop at a reductionist interpretation of contractual clauses.</p>

<p>There is value in establishing an environment of trust, where you allow variation in contracts within a range without needing to issue contractual amendments each time. However, we also want to avoid being captured by a supplier who can dictate terms unduly and become complacent.</p>

<p>One of the success factors in outcome-based contracts is ﬁnding an area where you can build trust between stakeholders and different sectors, without being naïve about it. Finding and codifying this balance, such as through legal mechanisms, allows trust to become an instrument for improvement.</p>

<p>The key lesson here is that we cannot rely on a legal contract to do all the work, so civil servants will still need to continually educate themselves, stay abreast of what is happening, and exercise judgement.</p>

<h5>INDIGO</h5> 

<div class="title2">
<p>International Network on Data Impacting Government Outcomes</p>
</div>
	
<p>INDIGO is a collaborative initiative of the Government Outcomes Lab. It gathers data—made available either publicly or through our stakeholders—related to impact bonds and outcome-based contracts from all over the world into an online database for like-minded individuals to learn from how these approaches have been used in the past.</p>
	
<p>For example, anyone who wants to launch a contract in education can go to INDIGO and ﬁnd similar contracts or data on related projects. They can look up or compare projects in a particular sector or region and reach out to people that were involved in past projects.</p>	
	
<p>INDIGO seeks to digitise and make accessible all empirical evidence on outcome-based contracts, as well as papers, reports and evaluations that provide credible empirical insights on how the outcome-based approach works. The aim is to bring evidence to bear in public sector decision-making, as well as to capture and promote institutional learning about this approach globally.</p>

<h5>How can governments better appreciate and harness the public value generated by other sectors?</h5>

<p>A lot of the conversations we have are about whether something should be done by the government or the private sector, and we leave out the social sector completely. I think it would be much better if we think about these three sectors, and consider: what are their comparative advantages?</p>

<p>The social sector has value that is distinct from public services. A government can generally only make standardised, broad provisions. But for many issues, you have to be very local—you have to think about a community’s or an individual’s unique needs. You need people who know the ground: who really needs help and who doesn’t. It’s not about legislation but local knowledge, and that’s a comparative advantage of the social sector.</p>

<div class="break">
<p class="break1">"A lot of the conversations we have are about whether 
something should be done by the government or the private sector, and we leave out the social sector completely."</p>
</div>

<p>The government should be asking: what are the areas the social sector does best? How can government and the private sector support the social sector so that everyone is working towards their comparative advantages?</p>

<p>Now, what is the right balance to strike between the sectors? This will depend on the societal context. It will be place speciﬁc. An appropriate balance for Singapore might be different from one for a bigger country like the UK, and the US will be different again.</p>

<p>In a place where people are very compliant with rules, a large public sector may make sense and there’s less of a need for a social sector. In the US, there could be greater acceptance of a larger role for the private or social sectors. A place that functions well with a relatively high tax rate, such as Scandinavia, could operate with a large public sector because there is cultural acceptance, whereas you could not get away with that in the US. So that’s going to have an impact on the size of the different sectors.</p>

<p>It will also depend on the local culture and people’s preferences: whether, for instance, there is a stigma associated with services provided by the social sector, or by government, or whether there is a culture of philanthropy with very high net worth individuals finding ways to do things the state cannot do.</p>

<div class="break">
<p class="break1">"  What is the right balance to strike between the sectors? A fundamental principle is: who  does it best?"</p>
</div>

<p>So, you’ll need to calibrate differently in different places. To my mind, a fundamental principle is: who does it best?</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that there’s not enough measurement of the impact of the social sector. I chair a commission called the Law Family Commission on Civil Society, which has to do with the social sector. Together with Andy Haldane, Chief Economist of the Bank of England and one of our trustees, we have been working on ways to measure the output of the social sector, and it turns out that their contribution is being underestimated possibly by a factor of up to ten.</p>

<p>The social sector can be relatively inefficient, partly because they are not held to account in quite the same way as the private or public sectors. People go into charities because they are passionate about, say, curing a disease; they are not passionate about spreadsheets and surveys. It’s good for them to say, well we’re helping all these people. They are doing this out of the goodness of their heart. The fact that they could do it much more efficiently is neither here nor there to them.</p>

<p>We also ﬁnd charities spending huge amounts of their money on just applying for grants, in a way that’s very inefficient. This is why at Pro Bono Economics, we have been trying to think about general ways of prompting the social sector to become more productive; to unleash their potential.</p>

<p>We provide charities with ways to measure their impact, doing simple things such as cost-beneﬁt analyses.</p>


<h5>What is needed to nurture a more productive relationship between the sectors?</h5>

<p>For government, there is ﬁrst a real need to understand the different sectors. Singapore is very good at getting civil servants to understand the private sector and getting the private and public sectors to work together. The UK is not as good: we have massive pay gaps, and a culture where we keep the private sector at arm’s length because of potential conﬂicts of interest.</p>

<p>But there should be few such conﬂicts between the public and social sectors. We could have internship sand secondments, to provide pathways for those in public or private sector careers to work in a charity.</p>

<p>Now, anyone who has worked in the public sector would tell you that working across departmental boundaries is the hardest thing. This is unlike the private sector where it’s unimaginable for the CEO to sit alone as the decision maker while some other committee does the work for him, to come along and just say yes or no. They would do it together.</p>

<p>Governments should be thinking much more about cross-departmental teams that break down functional barriers, with all the key people at the table. For example, civil servants might analyse what is going on, give the best facts, saying what we can do to help and what our constraints are, so that the politicians can have a good evidence base. The political leadership can then talk about the kind of solutions they have in mind, and the officials could then respond in turn to what could or could not work. But that’s just step one.</p>

<div class="break">
<p class="break1">"If you put all three sectors in a room to solve issues 
together, you might come up with new and very different answers which have everybody contributing, as opposed to it just being a government problem."</p>
</div>

<p>Step two is realising that perhaps the government cannot solve this problem entirely on its own, and you need to have a meeting where you bring in the other sectors to help address the problem. And then you get the three sectors together to come up with an answer where there is mutual advantage. If you put all three sectors in a room to solve issues together, you might come up with new and very different answers which have everybody contributing, as opposed to it just being a government problem.</p>

<p>One other advantage is that the other sectors get to understand why  government regulates in the way they regulate. They can then learn how best to work with policy as opposed to ﬁghting it—while at times pointing out that policy objectives aren’t quite right and trying to get them changed. Then we start to work together to get better societal outcomes as opposed to regarding it as a game of getting around the rules to maximise proﬁts.</p>

<p>So, what we need to look for are people who can get collaboration across sectors. It could be someone who has diverse experience in actually working in one or more of these sectors, who will understand the cultures of these sectors and how to make them appreciate each other. </p>

<p>You want collaborators, and you also want innovators—because we’re not going to solve these problems without some innovation. For really difficult problems, you need to experiment more, and try different things, and some of them might work along the way. </p>

<p>In the social sector there is great nervousness about having something which seems to fail. We need to have the capacity to understand that it’s not a problem if a social sector organisation spends some money on trying some things which turn out not to work. So you could bring in some private sector people who understand about innovation, about risk-taking, about not being scared to fail. But this can be difficult in the social sector. In the beginning, time might be better spent just helping charities put in competent record management systems and spreadsheets, or other kinds of administrative infrastructure that we take for granted in the public and private sectors. </p>

<p>One of the issues I am worried about is what I call stranded skills. A lot of people with a set of skills which they thought would keep them in good employment for a long time could end up being stranded by developments in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI). We will need to think carefully about how to get to the kind of world where we are all going to be living longer, and how we all need to retrain at different times. </p>

<p>This could ﬁt in with my idea of spending some time in different sectors, doing different things, and coming back as someone who understands the interaction between sectors. Indeed, we are already starting to see innovation being the consequence of being multidisciplinary, from economics to psychology and so on, in ways which will be crucial to the public sector. The point is also about trying to see people’s activities as things that bring them increases in wellbeing, as opposed to just work. </p>
