<h4>Register for a Programme:</h4>
<p class="mini-header">Searching for a programme</p> 

<p>You can search for your preferred programmes on <a target="_blank" href="https://register.csc.gov.sg/">CSC Programme portal</a>. 
You will be able to filter your search by Domain, Programme Type, Audience, Duration, Period and Cost. To filter by Domain, please log in as a public officer, and click on the <b>“Discover Our Programmes”</b> button at the top of the page. A small pop-out window will appear, and you can select your preferred domains by clicking on the <b>“Select a Domain”</b> field. A list of programmes from the selected domain will be displayed, with the rest of the filters located on the left side of the page.</p>

<p class="mini-header">No suitable dates for your desired programme?</p>

<p>Get notified when new dates are published – click the <b>‘Add to Watchlist’</b> button to receive email notifications when new classes are opened.</p>
		
<p class="mini-header" id="register">How to register for a programme?</p>
		
<p>You can register via our <a target="_blank" href="https://register.csc.gov.sg/">CSC Programme Portal</a>. Navigate to your desired programme, and click on the <b>"Apply Now”</b> button. Your Training Coordinator has up to 3 working days to approve your registration request. Once it’s been approved, you’ll receive an email notification. A simple guide on how you can register for a programme on the programme portal is linked <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/reg-pp">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> To attend milestone programmes, you have to be nominated by your agency. Contact your Training Coordinator to find out more.</p>
	
	
<p class="mini-header">When to register?</p>
<p>Register for a programme at least 1 month before the start date. Most programmes accept registrations on a first-come, first-serve basis, so it is better to register early. Registration normally closes 7 working days before each programme’s start date, unless otherwise stated.</p>
		
<p class="mini-header">Confirming your registration</p>
		
<p>We will inform you of your registration status 2 to 3 weeks before the programme starts. Once your registration is confirmed, we will send you a Programme Placement Letter (PPL) via a system-generated email from CSCOLLEGE Donotreply. While we will always do our best to confirm your registration as early as possible, classes may sometimes be postponed or cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
		
<p class="mini-header" id="disabilities">Learning with disabilities</p>
	
<p>The Civil Service College is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the diverse needs of its participants. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in the programme you are interested in, please feel free to discuss your concerns with your Training Coordinator and CSC’s <a href="mailto:cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg">Customer Experience Team</a>. Learners with disabilities may also wish to work with your Training Coordinator and CSC’s Customer Experience Team to discuss options to improve the learning experience for you. Please also let us know what level of assistance you prefer.</p>
		
		
<h4>Attending Your Programme:</h4>
		
<p class="mini-header" id="classroom-details">Where do I find the classroom details?</p>
		
<p>A system-generated Welcome Email, from CSCOLLEGE Donotreply, will be sent to you at least 1 week before to the class commencement date with log-in instructions to CSC's <a target="_blank" href="https://dc.learn.gov.sg/">Learn Digital Classroom</a>, where you will find all the details you need to attend your programme, including classroom details (for in-person programmes), zoom link (for virtual programmes), pre-learning materials and assignments (if any), and programme materials.</p> 
		
<p>Here is how:</p>		
		
<ol id="list-adjustment">
	<li>Log in to <a target="_blank" href="https://dc.learn.gov.sg">https://dc.learn.gov.sg</a> and scroll down to <b>“My Programmes”</b> to select the grid containing the name of the course you are attending.</li>
	<li>Scroll down to the <b>“Table of Contents”</b> to find:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The pre-learning materials under the <b>“Pre-course Preparations”</b> grid. Please complete any pre-course assignments that are required for the class</li>
			<li>Classroom link/details under the <b>“Classroom Details”</b> grid</li>
	</ul>
</ol>		
		
<p>A simple guide on the steps to login to Learn-DC and access the programme information is linked <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/learndc-proginfo">here</a>.</p>		
		
<p class="mini-header" id="mark-attendance">How do I mark my attendance?</p>
		
<p>From 6 November 2023 onwards, CSC will be piloting a new e-attendance process in phases. If you are attending <strong>a virtual programme or a milestone programme</strong>, you may mark your attendance by <b>“checking in”</b> to your programme. Here is how:</p> 		
		
<ol id="list-adjustment">
	<li>At the start of the class, your trainer will provide you with a QR code and a URL. Scan the QR code with your mobile devices or manually input the URL in your web browser to launch the eAttendance page.</li>	
	<li>Log in with your SingPass App.</li>	
	<li>Check that the details of your class are correct, and click on “Check-in”.</li>	
	<li>Confirm your check-in by clicking on the “Check-in” button in the pop-up.</li>	
	<li>Make sure that your attendance is captured under the “My Session Today” page</li>	
</ol>		
		
<p>Here’s a simple guide to help you along.</p>			
		
<img src="/images/FAQ/eatt%20steps_website%20faq.png">	
		
<p>To ensure your attendance is captured in a timely manner, please download the Singpass App on your mobile devices with camera functionality and set up your Singpass account (if you have yet to do so) prior to your class. We also recommend that you arrive at least 15 minutes before the class start time to have sufficient time to complete this check-in process.</p>
		
<p class="mini-header" id="missed-check-in">What if I missed my check-in?</p>		

<p>Check-in will close 90 minutes after the class has started. Thereafter, an email notification will be sent to your Training Coordinator to inform him/her that you have yet to check in. If you arrive after the check-in time, please inform your trainer and provide reasons for being late.</p>		
		
<p><strong>During the pilot phase, please scan your attendance using your NRIC at any kiosk found on levels 1 to 5 if you are attending in-person non-milestone programmes.</strong></p>		
		
		
		
<h4>Withdrawing Your Registration</h4>
		
<p class="mini-header" id="withdraw-application">Withdrawing your application before Training Coordinator (TC) approval</p>
		
<p>You may withdraw any application that your TC has not yet approved on the portal directly under the <b>“Check Application Status”</b> page by clicking on the <b>“Withdraw”</b> button on the relevant application under the <b>“Pending Applications”</b> section. A simple guide on the steps to cancel a pending application on the programme portal is linked <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/cancel-appln-pp">here</a></p>
		
<p class="mini-header" id="withdraw-registration">Withdrawing your registration after programme placement</p>			

<p>If you are scheduled for an upcoming CSC programme and you are unable to attend, here is what you need to do:</p>
		
<ol id="list-adjustment">
<li>Notify your training coordinator (TC) early, preferably at least 3 weeks before the class start date, otherwise a penalty fee may be incurred. All withdrawal / replacement / transfer requests have to be submitted by your TC.</li>	
<li>Concurrently, check among your colleagues if anyone is able to take your place for the programme. If yes, remember to seek your respective RO’s support, and provide the details (name, NRIC, email address) of your colleague to your TC.</li>
<li>If you have not found a replacement, please provide your TC the reason(s) you are unable to attend. If a penalty is incurred due to late notice, CSC will assess the reasons provided and determine if the penalty can be waived. Do note that reasons such as going on leave/vacation will not be accepted as these should have been planned ahead of time.</li> 
<li>Do note the withdrawal timelines below to avoid any penalties:</li></ol>

<h4>Managing Your Training Coordinator Account</h4>

<p class="mini-header">Creating / removing a Training Coordinator account</p>
	
<p>Please submit the Training Coordinator’s information in <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/add-remove-tc-bc">this form</a> and the account will be created/removed within 3 to 5 working days. The form can also be found on the TC’s Dashboard on the programme portal.</p>	
			
<p class="mini-header">Update your agency's contact list</p>	
<p>Email us at <a href="mailto:cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg">cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg</a> with the updates.</p>


<h4>Registering Your Officers for Programmes</h4>

<p id="individual-bulk" class="mini-header">Individual or bulk registration</p>
	
<p>You may register your officers individually or by "bulk” by using the <b>“Bulk Registration”</b> function . We will contact you if we are unable to accept all or some of your registrations. When submitting your registration, please ensure that you have entered your officers’ email addresses correctly as all subsequent communications would be sent to the listed email addresses directly. Incorrect emails may result in officers not receiving their Programme Placement Letters and Welcome emails. A simple guide on how you may submit registrations for your officers is linked <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/bulkreg-tc">here</a>.</p>
	
	
<p class="mini-header">Registration closing dates</p>

<p>Registration normally closes 7 working days before the start date, unless otherwise stated. If your officer chooses to register just before the closing date, you may need to submit the application directly on their behalf to avoid unsuccessful registration. </p>
	
	
<p class="mini-header" id="review">Reviewing your officer’s registration</p>

<p>When your officer registers for a programme, you have up to 3 working days to review and approve the registration request. Once you’ve approved it, your officer will be notified via email. However, if you register on an officer’s behalf, there is no review or approval required. A simple guide on the steps to approve your officer’s application on the programme portal is linked <a href="https://go.gov.sg/appr-appl-tc" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
		

<p class="mini-header">Unable to review registrations in time</p>
			
<p>If you don’t respond to a registration request by the end of the second day, it will be routed to your Covering TC (if any). Both the officer and you will be cc-ed in the email to your Covering TC. Any registration request not approved after the 3 working day period will lapse and cannot be reactivated. The officer can re-submit a new application if the application has lapsed.</p>
	
	
<p class="mini-header" id="covering-training">How to set “Covering Training Coordinator (TC)”</p>
	
<p>A Covering TC is another TC whom a pending application would be routed to for approval, if the selected TC does not approve the application by the end of the second day. You can set your Covering TC on the<b>“Profile”</b>page by clicking on the “Covering TC” button.</p>
	
<p> Only one Covering TC can be assigned to each TC. A simple guide on the steps to set a Covering TC on the programme portal is linked <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/set-coveringtc">here</a>.</p>
	
<p class="mini-header">Registration status</p>
					
	
<p>We will email the officer and you about the registration status 2 to 3 weeks before the programme starts. If registration is successful:</p>
	
<ul>
<li>The officer will receive a Programme Placement Letter (PPL).</li>
<li>You will receive a PPL summary for each programme (excluding eLearning programme). It lists the officers from your agency attending the programme.</li>

</ul>
	
<p><b>Note:</b> Whenever possible, we will send the PPLs as soon as the programme is confirmed. In most cases, we can only confirm the programme 3 weeks before it starts.</p>

	<p>Find out more on our <a target="_blank" href="/contact-us">Contact Us</a> page</p>
	
	
<h4 id="wrt-officers">Withdrawing / Replacing / Transferring Your Officers for Programmes</h4>
	
<p>All requests for withdrawal, replacement and/or transfer of participants are to be submitted by an agency’s TC via a Withdrawal / Replacement / Transfer Request Form in the TC module on the CSC Programme Portal. CSC will no longer handle email requests from learners, and will re-direct them back to their TCs.</p>
	
	
<p>TCs will be prompted to provide the following information:</p>
	
<ul>
<li>TC’s details</li>
<li>Details of the programme that officer is withdrawing from</li>
<li>Details of withdrawing officer</li>
<li>Reasons for withdrawing</li>
<li>If transferring to another session, the dates of the session to be transferred to</li>
<li>If there is one, the replacement officer’s details</li>
<li>Replacement Officer’s TC details and Billing Contact Details</li>
</ul>
	
<p>It is important to note that penalty fees will be levied if the notification to withdraw is received after the Programme Placement Letter has been sent, or less than 3 weeks before the class start date, whichever is later. Please see timeline below:</p> 
	
<img src="/images/FAQ/process_timeline_tcs.jpg">
	
<p>If penalty fees are incurred, CSC will assess if the penalty can be waived based on the reasons provided by the TC in the form. CSC will then inform the TC of the outcome over email within 5 working days.</p>

<p>Please also note the timelines for replacements and transfers:</p>
	
<ol id="list-adjustment">

<li type="a">Replacement requests: at least 5 working days before class starts</li>
<li type="a">Transfer requests: at least 5 working days before the original class starts and at least 5 working days before the new class starts.</li>

</ol>

<h4 id="officers-attendance">Attendance of Your Officers</h4>
	
<p>From 6 November 2023 onwards, CSC will be launching a new e-attendance process, in phases. If your officers are attending <strong>a virtual programme or a milestone programme</strong>, they may mark their attendance by “checking in” to their programme, on CSC’s eAttendance page.</p>

<p>A QR code and/or URL will be provided by their trainers at the start of their class. They can either scan the QR code or input the URL on their mobile web browser to launch the eAttendance page.</p>	
	
<img src="/images/FAQ/eatt%20steps_website%20faq.png">	
	
<p>To ensure that your officers’ attendance is captured in a timely manner, officers are highly encouraged to download the Singpass application on their mobile devices with camera functionality and set up their Singpass account (if they have yet to do so) prior to their class. We also recommend that they arrive at least 15 minutes before the class’s start time to have sufficient time to complete this process.</p>

<p>You will be notified via email of officer(s) who did not check-in within 90 minutes after the class has started. If your officers arrive after the check-in time, they would need to inform their trainer and provide reasons for being late.</p>
	
<p class="mini-header">What happens if my officer is absent for the class?</p>	
	
<p>Officers who do not meet the minimum attendance or are absent without valid reasons will be charged the full programme fee (before Training Subsidy). You will be informed to check with your officer on the reason for the absence. If your officer has a valid reason, please submit the ‘Appeal for Waiver of No-show Penalty Form’ via your TC dashboard in CSC’s Programme Portal no later than 5 working days from class end date. If we do not hear from you by then, the full programme fee will be charged to your agency.</p>	

<p>CSC’s decision on the waiver is final, and no further appeals will be considered. More information on the No-show process is linked&nbsp;
<a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/no-show-appeal">here</a>.</p>
	
<p><strong>For in-person programmes that are not milestone programmes, officers will still need to take their attendance by scanning their NRICs at any kiosk found on levels 1 to 5, until the next launch phase in 2 January 2024 for all programmes.</strong></p>
	
	
	
<p class="mini-header">Where to get assistance</p>
	
<p>Officers can email us at <a href="mailto:cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg">cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg</a> if they require assistance before their programme. If they require assistance on the day of their programme, they can approach the Trainers or Programme Administrators.</p>

<p>If you have any questions not addressed above, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg">cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg.</a></p>
	

<h4 id="request-in-house">Request for In-House Training</h4>
	
<p class="mini-header">In-house training</p>
		
<ul>

<li>We offer in-house training programmes to meet your agency’s specific needs and challenges. You can choose from standard or customised in-house programmes.</li>
	
</ul>
	
<p class="mini-header">Standard in-house programmes</p>

<ul>

<li>A standard in-house programme covers the same material as a public run programme. The advantage is that your organisation can choose the location and timing of the programme, and which officers to participate in it. Most programmes have an in-house option. Submit your request for standard in-house programmes <a target="_blank" href="https://form.gov.sg/60545d6f248bbc0012cc8ae5">here</a></li>
	
</ul>	
			
<p class="mini-header">Customised in-house programmes</p>

<ul>	

<li>If your agency has specific work challenges, a standard in-house programme may not meet your needs. We can customise our programmes by working with you to analyse and determine your agency’s training needs. Please submit your agency’s request <a target="_blank" href="https://form.gov.sg/60545d6f248bbc0012cc8ae5">here</a>.</li>
	


</ul>	
	
<p><b><i>Note: There is a development fee for customised programmes which will be in addition to the programme fee.</i></b></p>
	
<p class="mini-header">Class sizes</p>
	
<p>The minimum and maximum class sizes for in-house training are fixed. If your agency does not meet the minimum class size, please register them for a public run instead.</p>
	
<p class="mini-header">Costs</p>
		
<p>Please contact your Agency Engagement Manager to ask for a cost estimate.</p>
			
<p class="mini-header">Venues</p>
			
<p>We can conduct in-house programmes at CSC or at a location of your choice, as long as heavy logistics or specialised equipment are not required. You can reduce costs by having the programme conducted at your office.</p>
			
<p class="mini-header">How to apply for in-house training</p>
<p>Email your Agency Engagement Manager with the following:</p>
	
<ul>
				<li>Programme title</li>
				<li>Course code</li>
				<li>Preferred venue (CSC or your agency’s venue)</li>
				<li>Preferred training period (please allow a lead time of 8 weeks)</li>
				<li>Number of times you’d like to run the programme</li>
				<li>Standard in-house or customised programme request</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll respond within 3 – 5 working days. </p>
