			<h3>Case Studies: Designing Change</h3>
        <b><i>Edited by June Gwee</i></b>
<p>This book is intended as a primer for public officers on complexity and its applications to public policy. It recounts the steps the Singapore ,Government has taken to use complexity to better inform policymaking,from making long-term strategic planning more robust, to planning public transport infrastructure more holistically, to enabling senior citizens to age in place through improved community healthcare. It also examines what can be done in the years ahead to infuse an understanding of complexity across the public service.</p>

        <h3>Evidence-based Policymaking in Singapore: A Policymaker’s Toolkit</h3>
        <b><i>Multiple authors</i></b>
        <p>	This book covers a collection of tools commonly used in evidence-based
        policymaking and how they can strengthen policy design and decision-
        making. These range from broad, cross-cutting policy measures to
        seemingly operational interventions which contribute to larger policy
        objectives. Examples from Singapore and other countries are used to
        illustrate key learning points.</p>

        <h3>Case Studies: Building Communities in Singapore</h3>
        <b><i>Edited by June Gwee</i></b>
        <p>	
        This book contains four case studies on how public agencies design
        solutions to improve the quality of life for individuals and society by
        listening, observing and being empathetic to the needs of people. They
        describe how public officers have been able to think differently, find new
        paths and build resilient communities.
