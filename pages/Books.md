<h3>Case Studies: Designing Change</h3>
<b><i>Edited by June Gwee</i></b>

<p>This book is intended as a primer for public officers on complexity and its
applications to public policy. It recounts the steps the Singapore
Government has taken to use complexity to better inform policymaking,
from making long-term strategic planning more robust, to planning public
transport infrastructure more holistically, to enabling senior citizens to age
in place through improved community healthcare. It also examines what
can be done in the years ahead to infuse an understanding of complexity
across the public service.</p>

<h3>Evidence-based Policymaking in Singapore: A Policymaker’s Toolkit</h3>
<b><i>Multiple authors</i></b>

<p>	This book covers a collection of tools commonly used in evidence-based
policymaking and how they can strengthen policy design and decision-
making. These range from broad, cross-cutting policy measures to
seemingly operational interventions which contribute to larger policy
objectives. Examples from Singapore and other countries are used to
illustrate key learning points.</p>
