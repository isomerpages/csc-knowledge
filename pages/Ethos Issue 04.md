		<h3>Governance at the Leading Edge: Black Swans, Wild Cards, and Wicked Problems</h3>
		<b><i>Peter Ho</i></b>
		<p>At the 2008 Strategic Perspectives Conference, Head of Civil Service
Peter Ho traced the evolution of contemporary public sector practice.
He concludes that while the Public Service has successfully adopted best practices from the private sector and elsewhere in the past, these are not enough to ensure good governance as we move into an unpredictable and complex future. In the following excerpt, he highlights the nature of the challenges ahead and argues that Singapore must develop its own new
brand of governance in order to manage these critical uncertainties and generate original solutions to the wicked problems of our time.</p>
