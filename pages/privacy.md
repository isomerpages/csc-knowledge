3.  If you choose to make an application or send us an email for which you provide us with personally identifiable data, we may share necessary data with other Singapore Government agencies, so as to serve you in a most efficient and effective way, unless such sharing is prohibited by law.

4.  For your convenience, we may also display to you data you had previously supplied to us or to other Singapore Government agencies.
