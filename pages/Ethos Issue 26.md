		<h3><span class="cat">Issue 26 , Nov 2023</span><br> ETHOS Issue 26</h3>
		<p>This issue looks at the future of healthcare in Singapore. Ensuring a people’s health is a task vital to a society’s wellbeing, and a responsibility that goes beyond the ambit of healthcare professionals. A critical aspect of governing well, it rests on a whole-of-society will to take care of one another and ourselves. Gathering insights from a range of practitioners and thought leaders from both within and outside the Public Service, we explore how we can look after the health of Singaporeans–both holistically and for the long term.</p>
