        <div><h3>Successful Ageing –
A Review of Singapore’s Policy Approaches</h3>
            <b><i>Olivia Goh</i></b>
<p>In Singapore, the issue of an ageing population has been on

<div><h3>Ageing Repositioned:
Singapore in the New Global Demography</h3>
            <b><i>Sarah Harper</i></b>
            
<p>Singapore will soon be one of the demographically oldest countries in East Asia, as measured by the proportion of the population aged 65 and over. The median age of Singapore residents has increased over the past quarter-century, from 24.4 years in 1980 to over 35 today. This has been fuelled by a fall in Singapore’s Total Fertility Rate, which now stands at 1.24 per resident female, one of the lowest in the world.</p>
