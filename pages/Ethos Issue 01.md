		<h3>Foreword</h3>
		<b><i>Peter Ho</i></b>
		<p>We are at an inflexion point. Globalisation and rapid advances in technology are transforming business, politics and society. The simultaneous rise of China and India are changing trade flows and mapping out new patterns of influence. </p>

 <p>Our inaugural issue brings to bear some of the leading minds on a matter of global concern and national interest: Ageing. By 2050, the number of persons over 60 years of age will exceed that of children globally for the first time in human history. Singapore is also expected to age rapidly. What can we expect in the decades to come and what can we do about it today?</p>

        <div><h3>Successful Ageing –
A Review of Singapore’s Policy Approaches</h3>
            <b><i>Olivia Goh</i></b>
<p>In Singapore, the issue of an ageing population has been on
the national agenda since the 1980s, with several high-level
committees formed to study ageing trends.</p>

<div><h3>Ageing Repositioned:
Singapore in the New Global Demography</h3>
            <b><i>Sarah Harper</i></b>
            
<p>Singapore will soon be one of the demographically oldest countries in East Asia, as measured by the proportion of the population aged 65 and over. The median age of Singapore residents has increased over the past quarter-century, from 24.4 years in 1980 to over 35 today. This has been fuelled by a fall in Singapore’s Total Fertility Rate, which now stands at 1.24 per resident female, one of the lowest in the world.</p>
