<p>Case studies have been used in CSC’s training programmes as early as 1993. Today, they remain a key
learning intervention for CSC and training institutes within the Singapore Public Service. Within the
College, case studies can be found in our programmes, publications and the LEARN digital learning
platform of the Singapore Public Service. Here is a collection of resources to help training managers,
learning designers, educators and knowledge managers understand CSC’s approach to case studies and
case writing. Public officers who are interested to learn how to write case studies and use them for
	learning and development can sign up for CSC’s <a href="#">case writing <b>workshop here.</b></a></p>

<b>Evolution of the CSC Case Study</b>

<p>The Civil Service College has been using case studies as a pedagogical tool as early as 1993. At the
College, the development of case studies started for two reasons: to develop content for training, and
second, to capture institutional knowledge on the practice of public governance, policymaking and
	public administration. Find out more on the <a href="#">evolution of the CSC case study</a> in the last two decades.</p>

<b><a href="#">The Case Writer’s Toolkit</a></b>
<p>This book deconstructs the case study, describes the case writing process and explains how a good case
study is composed. It is a reference book that serves as a guide for writers who develop case studies for
	teaching, research and knowledge-capture.</p>
