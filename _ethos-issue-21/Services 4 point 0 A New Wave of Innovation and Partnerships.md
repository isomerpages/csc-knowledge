<h3>What is Services 4.0?</h3>

<p>Over the past few decades, we have seen
the services economy evolve from the
era of manual services (1.0) to efficient
Internet-enabled services (2.0) to self-services
enabled by mobile, wireless
and cloud technologies (3.0). In phase
4.0, we envision <strong>seamless </strong>services that
are <strong>end-to-end</strong>, <strong>frictionless</strong>, <strong>empathic
</strong>and which <strong>anticipate </strong>customer needs
using emerging technologies. This is the
vision for Singapore’s digital economy
articulated in the Services and Digital
Economy (SDE) Technology Roadmap,
launched in late 2018.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of services
offered and customers’ preferences,
some organisations may choose to keep
part of their products or processes at
various levels, or provide Services 4.0
selectively. What is important is to figure
out where this makes sense and decide
deliberately, based on the potential and
relevance of new technologies.</p>

<h3>Services 4.0: An Evolutionary Journey</h3>

<img title="Evolutionary journey" style="vertical-align: middle;" src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_21/Evolutionary_Journey.jpg" alt="Evolutionary journey">

<h3>What Technology Trends Are Enabling This?</h3>

<p>The SDE Technology Roadmap identifies nine key technology
trends that will drive the transition to Services 4.0. I highlight
three of these trends that have broad-ranging potential to
change the way we experience services, how fast they can be
delivered, and the kinds of jobs and skills we will see in the future.<br>
<br>
<br>

<img title="Tech roadmap" style="vertical-align: middle;" src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_21/TechRoadmap.jpg" alt="Tech roadmap"></p>

<h3>Pervasive Adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>

<p>In the next three to five years, globally,
there is an expected exponential increase
in commercial AI-based applications in
three major categories:</p>

<p>• Product applications that embed AI
in products and services to provide
end-customer benefits (e.g., Google
Maps or Apple’s Siri)<br>
• Process applications
that incorporate AI
into an organisation’s
workflow to automate
processes or augment
worker effectiveness
(e.g., Robotic Process
Automation), or <br>
• Insight applications
that harness advanced
capabilities to inform
operational and
strategic decisions
across an organisation
(e.g., machine learning).</p>

<p>Retail, finance and logistics
are three industries that
already heavily utilise AI. In retail, AI is
used to personalise recommendations,
perform store and crowd analytics, and
manage pricing. In logistics, AI is used
to manage inventory, and optimise
distribution routes, task allocation,
scheduling and shipping. In finance,
AI is applied in areas like identity
authentication and verification, banking
transactions and payments.</p>

<p>How might AI unlock new value? An
economist might think of AI as a tool
that lowers the cost of prediction. It used
to be prohibitively expensive to make
personalised recommendations at scale,
but AI has made this accessible for many companies. Current AI tools are both
specific and powerful, offering us ways
of applying prediction that can facilitate
better decisions under uncertainty.</p>

<p>Developments in machine intelligence
will mean <strong>more empathic</strong>, <strong>cognitive
and&nbsp;affective AI</strong>. AI assistants are being
trained to better detect and understand
emotions, analyse moods and sentiments
to better connect with customers, and
be more responsive in customer service.</p>

<div class="break">

<p class="break1">
Humans and AI algorithms working together have been shown to perform better than either humans or AI acting alone.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Human-Machine Collaborations </h3>

<p>At the heart of Services 4.0
is an ecosystem allowing
machines to augment
workers’ performance
by automating repetitive
tasks. This lets workers
focus on more “human”
tasks such as creativity,
critical and analytical
thinking, emotional
intelligence, innovation
and judgment. For
instance, a private banker can spend
more time with his clients and less
time on administrative on-boarding
paperwork if the back-end processes
can tap on information databases and
provide relevant alerts.</p>

<p>In what has come to be known as
“collaborative intelligence”, humans and
AI algorithms working together have
been shown to perform better than
either humans or AI acting alone. For
example, in healthcare, doctors working
in tandem with AI achieve higher rates
of diagnostic accuracy than either AI
or doctors working by themselves. In
freestyle chess, a “centaur” team of
humans and machines does better than
either human-only or machine-only
competitors.</p>

<h3>Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS)</h3>

<p>Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) is an approach in which capabilities,
products and processes are treated not in individual silos but as a horizontal
palette of services available across organisational boundaries. With XaaS,
organisations may even extend their
internal services to become digital edge
businesses serving external customers
and partners.</p>

<p>Such developments are made possible
by a technology ecosystem built on
<strong>Cloud Native architecture</strong>. This features
multi-cloud, component services that can
be reused in a variety of applications,
as well as Application Programming
Interfaces (API) that make available
component services from best-in-class
providers or which offer new services
to external parties. What this all means
is that organisations can be more agile
and flexible, gain access to a wider
ecosystem of resources and deliver new
products and services more quickly.</p>

<h3>How Can the Public Sector Harness Services 4.0?</h3>

<p> As the Public Service as a whole transforms
to better serve users, Services 4.0
can help public sector agencies think
through the next step in how services
are provided to citizens, businesses and
internal customers. There are three key
aspects to consider: <strong>Anticipating Needs</strong>,<strong>
Augmenting Workers </strong>and <strong>Partnerships</strong>.</p>

<div class="break">

<p class="break1">
The challenge is to think about whether we can anticipate specific needs, and organise ourselves to deliver just-in-time services in response or stop problems before they occur.
</p>

</div>


<br>
<h4>Anticipating Needs</h4>
<p>Beyond merely meeting needs, the
challenge is to think about whether
we can anticipate specific needs, and
organise ourselves to deliver justin-
time services in response or stop
problems before they occur. We already
have a range of tools such as design
thinking to support service journeys
and business process re-engineering.
These can be further coupled with the
power of larger or more combined
datasets and AI applications, to solve
real world problems or contribute to
fundamental improvements in customers’
lived experiences.</p>

<p>For policymakers,
questions to reflect
on might include how
we might advance
social services to better
identify those vulnerable
or at risk. We should
think about how data
and interventions can
be brought together
across a range of
domains, such as social
needs, healthcare or
employment, to deliver
individualised assistance
for specific situations.</p>

<p>On the business front,
we might be able to
customise economic
support or assistance for
companies at different
stages of growth, or based on particular
transactions they conduct.</p>

<p>We should also think about how
we can <strong>build citizen and customer
confidence in AI</strong>. There is growing
potential for AI to be deployed in our
organisations in future. Internationally,
there is increasing discussion about
how organisations can be responsible
AI users and mitigate different risks in
AI deployment. Companies are starting
to consider how they can minimise or
mitigate inherent bias in their algorithms,
or how to enhance the explainability
of AI (i.e., explaining how deployed AI
models’ algorithms function or how the
decision making process incorporates
model predictions). In January 2019,
IMDA released a <strong>proposed model AI
governance framework </strong>which provides
a set of principles and practical guidance
for organisations looking to embrace
greater use of AI.<a href="#notes"><sup>1</sup></a></p>



<div class="containerbox">
<h3 class="title">Services 4.0 in IRAS</h3>

<p class="small-text text">With its service mantra of “No Need
for Service is the Best Service”,
IRAS aspires to go beyond merely
converting manual processes to
digital services: it wants to reduce
processes that require input
from taxpayers.</p>

<p class="text">In 2016, IRAS set out to anticipate
and then integrate customer needs
into taxpayer-centric processes
focused on life cycles or business
operations. IRAS developed
partnerships with the private sector
to advance digital tax solutions.
Through its API marketplace, it
introduced various APIs that let
accounting software developers
seamlessly integrate tax issues
into accounting systems that
businesses are already using.
This has enabled new services
such as letting employers submit
salary details to IRAS with just a
single click.</p>

<p class="text">IRAS has also invested in futureproofing
its workforce by driving
adoption of Robot Process Automation
(RPA) at the enterprise level and
equipping officers to serve the
public using digital channels. About
50 of IRAS’s non-IT officers have
been certified as RPA developers.</p>
</div>


<br>
<h4>Augmenting Workers</h4>
<p>Services 4.0 is about creating the workplace
of the future, where humans and machines
collaborate closely for higher productivity and
to create greater value. Technology has the
potential to boost the
productivity of many
jobs. Many organisations
are deploying RPA to
free up time typically
spent on manual, time-consuming
tasks such as form filling, checking
figures or combining multi-source input.
This enables workers to spend more time on more higher level
tasks such as analysis or customer
engagement. Furthermore, while AI can
provide predictive power far beyond
what a single human can do, it does
not substitute for human judgment. AI
therefore improves rather than replaces
human decision-making.</p>

<p>What this means is that
Singapore needs to invest
massively in equipping
our workforce with digital
skills. All public officers,
regardless of their roles,
need to be comfortable with
using technology. They will
increasingly need digital skills, such as
using RPA and data analytics. At the same
time, relational skills such as creativity,
judgement, empathy, negotiation and
collaboration will be even more highly
valued by organisations.</p>


<p class="small-text text">Singtel has introduced RPA assistants that augment business
units’ capabilities and increase efficiencies.</p>

<div class="containerbox">
<h3 class="title">Robo-colleagues in Singtel</h3>

<p class="text">Singtel has introduced RPA
assistants that augment business
units’ capabilities and increase
efficiencies. Non-technical staff
have been equipped with the
skills to develop their own bots,
which can help with digital sales,
resolve technical issues in the field,
and automate claims processing.
Singtel ’s chatbot, Shirley, can
support call centre agents by
suggesting appropriate responses
to customers. In the future, we
will see more organisations like
Singtel, where human colleagues are
able to take on more value-added
work by tapping on the service of
robo-colleagues who help them
with certain tasks or processes.</p>
</div>


<br>
<h4>Partnerships</h4>
<p>For both the public and private sectors,
partnerships are key enablers for realising
Services 4.0. For citizen journeys to be
more integrated, we have to connect
multiple processes across agencies, or
work with platforms that are already
being used by customers.</p>

<p>Public sector organisations looking for
good technology partners can tap on
<strong>IMDA’s Accreditation@SG Programme</strong>,
which accredits promising and innovative
Singapore-based infocomm and media
companies, based on technical assessments
of their products, financial assessment,
people and processes. The programme
collaborates with government agencies
to come up with potential solutions and
match accredited companies to address
problem statements.</p>

<p>Good practices to enable smooth and
successful collaborations with private
sector partners include:</p>

<p>• Staying up to date with changes in
the technology landscape as well as
use cases in enterprises and other
government agencies.<br>
• Sharing problem statements and
domain knowledge openly, to enable
collaboration and co-development of
more transformative and innovative
solutions.<br>
• Management giving working teams
leeway to try fast, fail fast and learn
fast, to continuously iterate and keep
innovating.</p>

of Communication and Information, Infocomm Media Development Authority, and National Library
Board collaborated with Taiger, an AI and business process automation company. </p>

<h3 class="title">AI Collaboration with Accreditation@SG Company</h3>

<p class="text">For a joint ideation workshop,
Ministry of Culture &amp; Youth, Ministry
of Communication and Information,
Infocomm Media Development
Authority, and National Library
Board collaborated with Taiger, an
AI and business process automation
company. The agencies provided
domain knowledge and problem
statements in procurement, while
Taiger provided tech knowledge to
propose new ways of addressing the
challenges. Taiger then produced
a quick prototype concept to
solidify the ideas. The partners are
now working on a multi-agency
procurement virtual assistant
pi lot to handle a majority of
procurement enquiries consistently
with the agencies.

Services 4.0 is about reimagining the future and having the courage to disrupt ourselves before we get disrupted.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>To realise the ambition of Services 4.0,
Singaporeans and the enterprises they
work for will have to take on digital skills
and embrace digital tools and solutions.
Without this, key advances in technology
such as AI will remain the
preserve of a small number
of companies and their
workforce, exacerbating
wage disparities.</p>

<p>Whether in small or large
companies, leadership is
key to setting the right
mindset for embracing new
technology. Every technology
strategy needs a people
strategy. Leaders need to be
clear that digital transformation is part
of every business line’s responsibility,
and is not just for the IT department or
an innovation lab to take up. Leaders
also need to help middle management
understand technology so that they
can change how products and services
are designed and delivered. The
organisation must also give workers
the necessary support to pick up new
skills and encourage them to invest in
the digitalisation journey.</p>

<p>Services 4.0 is about reimagining the
future and having the courage to disrupt
ourselves before we get disrupted. As
a nation, Singapore must reimagine
our value proposition to the region and
the world in a digital age, even as we
strengthen the position we have already
built up through physical connectivity.
Our enterprises and public agencies
must figure out what new value they
can bring to their customers, what
their competitive strengths are, and
where they should bring in partners. As
individuals, each of us can keep abreast
of technology trends, and help each
other do the same. Together, we can
leverage technology to create better
solutions and enable more meaningful
and enriching lives.</p>
