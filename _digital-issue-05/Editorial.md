<p>The release in 2008 of Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler’s seminal book <i>Nudge</i> has redoubled interest around the world in applying a deeper understanding of decision-making mindsets and behaviours to public policy goals. As public agencies
    explore and experiment with subtle behavioural interventions, or nudges, to encourage desirable outcomes among the public, a more nuanced understanding of how they can best be applied is emerging—including a realisation of use cases where they
    may be less appropriate or less effective, or even counterproductive.</p>
<p>In this issue of ETHOS Digital Edition, we have brought together perspectives on how behavioural insights can contribute to policymaking and intervention in constructive ways.</p>
<p><a href="nudge-and-sludge-a-conversation-with-dilip-soman.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Expounding on the concept of sludge</a>—procedural, cultural or other impedance to desired behavioural change—Canadian scholar
    Dilip Soman points out that policymakers should be mindful of unacknowledged factors that could trip up otherwise well-intended programmes and initiatives.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, researcher Ong Qiyan, from the National University of Singapore’s Social Service Research Centre, offers <a href="how-to-nudge-better-in-public-policy.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">three key principles that underlie effective behavioural nudges</a>.
 She argues that opt-out options are an important element in ensuring the effectiveness of behavioural interventions, because they allow individuals to tailor choices to their specific needs. Poor communication of opt-out options could breed confusion
    and mistrust, while counternudges by the private sector or other players could undercut the impact of nudge measures.</p>
<p>Economist Lorenz Gotte explains <a href="using-behavioural-insights-more-effectively-in-policy-interventions.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">how behavioural interventions stack up against more conventional measures</a>, suggesting
    that the two forms of public policy action could usefully reinforce each other, particularly when individuals are given clear feedback about the impact of their actions.</p>
<p>Do Hoang Van Khanh from the Civil Service College and Low Weijian from the Land Transport Authority report from a successful <a href="encouraging-car-lite-travel-through-gamification-the-kids-smart-travel-challenge.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">pilot study to shift student and parental attitudes towards public transport</a>&nbsp;travel
 to and from school. The initiative exemplifies how nudges, including gamification approaches, can be applied in real world situations to improve attitudes towards public transport.</p>
<p>As always, we wish you an engaging read and would love to hear from you if you have any comments or suggestions.</p>
