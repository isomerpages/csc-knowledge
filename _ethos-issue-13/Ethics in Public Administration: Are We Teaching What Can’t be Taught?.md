<h3>Introduction</h3>  
  
<p>The elimination of corruption has been at the top of the government agenda, and a strategic tenet of governance in Singapore<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">1</sup></a> since its independence. Singapore’s stringent and comprehensive anti-corruption framework, highly regarded worldwide, has paid off: it has been ranked as the least corrupt of the 13 Asian Countries on Transparency International’s corruption perception index, and is consistently among the top five least corrupt countries.<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">2</sup></a> </p>  
  
<p>Unfortunately, recent cases involving senior civil service officers and the misuse of public funds<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">3</sup></a> have led to fresh concerns over the long-cherished integrity of the Public Service. Were these failures of procedure and administrative compliance, or the outcome of a more fundamental cultural change? Some have even theorised that the advent of New Public Management since the 1980s, which led to a paradigm shift from the traditional bureaucratic form of government towards entrepreneurial government,<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">4</sup></a> may have created new tensions between private sector values and the traditional roles, responsibilities and standards in the public sector.<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">5</sup></a> Could these new conditions have prompted ethical challenges in public administration?<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">6</sup></a> Are there ways in which the ethical foundation of public administration can be reinforced to help preserve the integrity of public service, and address mounting calls for greater public accountability?</p>  
  
  
  
  
<p class="small-text text">Like many developed countries, the Singapore Civil Service has largely adopted a compliance-based approach to ethics management: it lays down a set of principles — through its service-wide Instruction Manual (IM) — that guides the conduct of civil servants and establishes internal control procedures on financial control, procurement, staff matters, asset management and other matters. The IM also empowers central agencies to perform compliance checks and audits. </p>  
  
<p class="small-text text">New and in-service officers are given many opportunities, through extensive induction programmes and other training to be familiar with the appropriate procedures pertaining to their work, although such courses tend to focus on the application of prescribed guidelines and procedures. </p>  
  
<p class="small-text text">Ethics is covered in key milestone programmes<a href=""><sup>1</sup></a> designed for managers and those being groomed for leadership positions — these segments encompass lectures, story-telling and vignette discussions on a variety of contexts, but do not do not necessarily address issues of moral character and ethical judgement in specific dilemmas, e.g. in procurement. There may be room to consider including ethics education in specific domain areas such as procurement, HR management and public engagement, all of which can present quite different ethical challenges.</p>

<h3>Ethics Management: The Low and High Roads</h3>  
  
<p>The literature offers two broad approaches to the systematic management of ethics in public sector organisations: compliance-based and integrity-based,<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">7-9</sup></a> also referred to as the low-road and high-road approaches respectively. </p>  
  
<p>The compliance or low-road approach emphasises the importance of external controls on the behaviour of civil servants. Formal and detailed rules and procedures are formulated to guide the decision-making process so that “the individual ethical choice is limited to choosing to follow the rules (ethical thing to do) or to violate them by commission or omission (unethical acts)”.<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">10</sup></a> Instruments typical to this approach include legislation, codes of conduct and ethics, extensive control mechanisms, and centralised control institutions with extensive powers.<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">11</sup></a> </p>  
  
<p>The integrity or high-road approach focuses on internal self-control exercised by individual civil servants, and is based on two components: moral judgement and moral character. Hejka-Ekins<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">12</sup></a> suggests that the moral judgement of an individual civil servant can be strengthened by cultivating the necessary values and norms, as well as by developing the skills in ethical decision-making needed to apply those values in daily work situations. Moral character, defined as the intrinsic will to act upon judgements reached through ethical decision-making,<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">12</sup></a> could be stimulated and improved through interactive training sessions, workshops and individual coaching.<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">11</sup></a> </p>  
  
<p>While these two approaches may seem to belong to opposite poles of management, they need not contradict each other, and in practice best ought to be used in combination, complementing and reinforcing desired behaviours.<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">13</sup></a></p>

<h3 class="title">Critical Goals and Desired Outcomes for Ethics Training</h3>  
<p class="text"> </p>  
<p>The Walton, Sterns and Crespy Framework<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">1</sup></a> sets out three critical goals and three desired learning outcomes in the teaching of ethics.</p>  
<p><strong>Critical Goals</strong></p>  
<ol>  
<li>Develop an awareness of ethical issues and problems in the field;</li>  
<li>Build analytical skills that can address those problems when they arise; and</li>  
<li>Cultivate an attitude of moral obligation and personal responsibility as part of public service.</li>  
</ol>  
<p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></p>  
<ol>  
<li>Develop an understanding of the diverse perspectives of moral philosophers;</li>  
<li>Understand how to frame the ethical dilemma in a model that allows discussion from diverse perspectives; and</li>  
<li>Develop the skills necessary for playing out the conflicts that arise so that trainees can measure the extent to which they have fulfilled the manifold and conflicting moral obligations they have identified.</li>  
</ol>  
<p>Since approaches to ethics teaching and training vary widely, different goals could be addressed. Other researchers have suggested alternative goals such as “understand regime values”,<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">2</sup></a> “develop an operational ethics”<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">3</sup></a> or “reasoning of values underlying decisions with public impact”.<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">4</sup></a></p>

<h3>Can Ethics Be Taught?</h3>  
  
<p>Ethical decision-making and moral development have long been central themes in the exploration of administrative ethics.<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">14, 15</sup></a> While morality is often associated with personal beliefs and values (prompting some contention about which values ought to be taught through formal curricula), Kohlberg<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">16</sup></a> argues that moral development is a process of maturation that arises from thinking about moral issues. Scholars such as Churchill also make a useful distinction between “morals” and “ethics” — he defines “morals as the behaviours of a human and ethics as a systematic rational reflection upon that behaviour.”<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">17</sup></a> </p>  
  
<p>If ethics can be regarded as a form of critical thinking about moral dilemmas, then it can plausibly be taught. Ethical teaching would therefore be the means by which to cultivate “a method of moral reasoning through complex ethical issues ... the primary function is to teach ethical systems of analysis, not moral standards of behaviour.”<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">18</sup></a> </p>  
  
<p>Indeed, there is general scholarly consensus<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">19</sup></a> that ethics training should be an important and integrated part of the training of civil servants, particularly to develop in leaders an understanding of ethics and a moral reasoning that demonstrates stability, empathy and integrity. Research interest in ethical decision-making and moral development, particularly in the context of officeholders and corporate whistleblowers, has grown in recent years.<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">20</sup></a></p>  
  
<h3>Approaches to Ethical Training and Moral Development</h3>  
  
<p>Approaches to ethical teaching vary widely across institutions that feature it,<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">21</sup></a> and there is no clear consensus in the literature on which is the most effective.</p>  
  
<p>Live instruction is a common approach: “reality-based and practical, involving hypothetical scenarios, case materials, or role-plays or short exercises — methods consistent with most descriptions of best training practices”.<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">22</sup></a> Among the more frequently used methods are small-group discussions, case studies, research papers and lectures. </p>  
  
<p>In the teaching of business ethics, case studies have been recognised as a promising pedagogical tool to “build a halfway house between abstract concepts and real life experience”.<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">23</sup></a> Case studies provide real decision scenarios in which students apply moral values and principles, explore conflicting dilemmas and subsequently move from doctrine to judgement.<a href="#notes"><sup class="#notes">24,25</sup></a> Cases may also illustrate the complex and ambiguous information and myriad of stakeholder pressures that are part of the decision-making environment.</p>  
  
<h3>Conclusion</h3>  
  
<p>An important aspect of ethics education in our public administration is communicating how the standards and instructions inherent in the Code of Conduct and Instruction Manuals should be applied in real-life workplaces. Since last year, the Civil Service College (CSC), in collaboration with lead agencies such as the Public Service Division and the Ministry of Finance, has launched numerous initiatives to support ethics education in the Singapore public sector. For example, easy-to-use handbooks on procurement and the Code of Conduct have been developed: important principles are simplified and brought to life with illustrations that highlight key issues and potential pitfalls. In addition, researchers documenting cases from across the Public Service that demonstrate how officers’ poor judgement have led to major lapses, misconduct and fraud. These cases will be used in CSC’s training programmes to raise awareness of ethical issues and to facilitate classroom discussions. In the longer term, CSC hopes to establish a common curriculum to embed values and ethics in milestone programmes and other relevant courses for officers at different levels and in different roles.</p>
