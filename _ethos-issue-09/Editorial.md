<em><small>ETHOS Issue 09, June 2011</small></em>

<p>A recent article in <em>THE ECONOMIST</em><a href="#notes"><sup>1</sup></a> portrays the public sector as pathologically inured to the productivity-enhancing initiatives that have transformed the private sector – although Singapore seems to buck the trend against OECD benchmarks. The general discourse on boosting productivity – be it the application of technology, worker retraining, or process reengineering – has likewise been targeted at businesses and employees rather than at governments. This is surely a pity: beyond the necessary tedium of due diligence and regulatory oversight which prevents (or could have prevented) systemic crisis, the public sector in any advanced country is a tremendous repository of information, expertise, energy and goodwill that, if judiciously applied, could multiply the efforts of all players in creating value for their respective fields.</p>  
  
<p>  
The key is to better understand the evolving value proposition of the public service. Where there is a clear sense of how the public sector contributes to national outcomes, the considerable mechanisms of state can be cogently directed towards appropriate ends: whether it be to reduce barriers to productive activity, to channel resources to promising new sectors, or to unlock potential value by making infrastructure and information more widely available.</p>  
  
<p>  
Bureaucracies may well have a tendency to rigidify along their functional structures if not much more than staid goalkeeping is expected of them. This however need not be the natural state of a vigorous, value-generating public service. Permanent Secretary Chan Lai Fung from the Ministry of Finance envisions a <a href="/ethos-issue-09/government-2/">Government 2.0</a>&nbsp;spirit in which boundaryless, agile and expert task forces marshal whole-of-government resources towards national outcomes, in fruitful partnership with the private sector. A survey of large-scale collaborative projects in the <a href="/ethos-issue-09/reviewing-whole-of-government-collaboration-in-the-singapore-public-service/">Singapore Public Sector</a>&nbsp;and new insights into the emergent phenomena of <a href="/ethos-issue-09/networked-governance-why-it-is-different-and-how-it-can-work/">collaborative networks</a>&nbsp;offer lessons on how pan-sectoral initiatives could yield even more productive results. The rise of new <a href="/ethos-issue-09/the-age-of-big-data/">data-driven industries</a>&nbsp;could see the public sector become the critical provider of a new factor of production: ubiquitous information. These developments are more than thought experiments – they are at the forefront of thinking about how governments can contribute to national growth: as an active participant in the value creation process, or by opening up whole new value streams for others to tap.</p>  
  
<p>  
The emphatic importance of being clear about national goals and the larger purposes of growth informs the insights of <a href="/ethos-issue-09/that-elixir-called-productivity-ten-implications-for-singapore/">Jesus Felipe</a>, who offers further suggestions on how the public sector can enhance Singapore's national productivity, and of Harvard Professor <a href="global-growth-local-governance.html">Dani Rodrik</a>, who sees room in a globalised world for small nations to be savvy and selective about their developmental choices. South Korea, also a case study in directed development, seems to be mobilising its national energies in order to establish a firm niche for itself in an <a href="five-reasons-korea-is-the-future.html">Asia-led future</a>. Highlighting the many ways in which governments play a vital role in the health of market economies, <a href="government-and-markets-in-a-well-functioning-economy.html">Donald Low and Wu Wei Neng</a>&nbsp;from the Centre for Public Economics also point out the limits of intervention. While public policy cannot account for all variables, <a href="risk-and-resilience-in-a-changing-world.html">David Skilling</a>&nbsp;argues that a balanced and managed approach to risk under increasingly complex conditions can itself be a source of competitive advantage in a volatile world. A more resilient nation, better prepared for uncertain conditions whether economically, socially or otherwise, is in a stronger position to brave the frontiers where the next wave of growth might be found.</p>  
  
<p>  
Also in this issue: an account of <a href="modernising-public-sector-management-recent-reforms-in-western-australia.html">Western Australian public service reforms</a>&nbsp;to engender greater flexibility, accountability and streamline interagency operations. <a href="opinion-social-policy-in-singapore-a-crucible-of-individual-responsibility.html">Ron Haskins</a>&nbsp;from the Brookings Institution finds the emphasis on personal responsibility in Singapore's social policies a strong contributor to national resilience. <a href="strategic-orientations-in-singapore-healthcare.html">Drs Jeremy Lim and Clive Tan</a>&nbsp;examine how the principles underlying Singapore's healthcare policies are expressed in the structure of the healthcare industry.</p>  
  
<p>  
I wish you a stimulating read.</p>
