<h3>What is social sensemaking and why does it matter?</h3>

<p>Behavioural nudging is a popular tool for policymakers, but research suggests that social sensemaking may reduce their effectiveness.1 Social sensemaking is when individuals try to infer the intent behind the choice architect's decision and what their decision would signal to the choice architect and/or other people around them. This can forestall the automatic cognitive biases that make nudges effective. In some cases, questioning the motives of the choice architect can even lead to backfiring on the intended outcome of  the nudge.</p>

<p>Under Future of Work, we are leveraging data, and data analytics, to relook at how the public sector should be working in the future, including how public officers interact with, ﬁeld enquiries from, and work alongside citizens. The pandemic has changed how we work; it has made us realise that a lot of what we do can be digitalised and carried out online for an enhanced experience.</p>

<h4 style="color:white;">A BACKFIRED NUDGE </h4>

<p>In 2016, the Dutch government—encouraged by the success of opt-out organ donation systems in many countries where residents are automatically considered organ donors unless they explicitly state their non-consent—passed a bill to switch their organ donation system from an opt-in to an opt-out scheme.</p>	
	
	
<p>However, unlike in other countries, this change resulted in a 40-times increase of opt-out requests in the Netherlands. This dramatic jump in active rejections occurred not only among newly registered donors but also among those who had previously consented to donate but now deliberately revoked their consent. One explanation for this backlash is that some Dutch residents may have interpreted the change in choice architecture as an attempt by the government to limit their freedom of choice, prompting them to explicitly exercise their opt-outs in protest.<sup>1</sup> </p>
