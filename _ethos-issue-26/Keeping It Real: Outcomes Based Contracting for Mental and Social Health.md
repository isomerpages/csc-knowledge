<h3>An outcomes-based approach to addressing mental health </h3>	
	
<p>Be it in high- or low-income countries, mental health is part and parcel of everyday existence. There is no physical health without mental health, and there is no social health without mental health. Social health has to do with one’s ability to perform in the labour market; to do well at school; to raise a healthy baby; to age well without ending up as a significant cost burden to the community. </p>
	
<p>The Healthy Brains Global Initiative (HBGI) was established to address the global lack of understanding and data around mental health. Such data as exists tends to be from white wealthy communities, outside of which there is a paucity of data. HBGI set out initially to try and fill that gap, raising money to collect the data. It was a struggle because, I think, donors wanted to pay not for data but solutions. HBGI also had no clear operating model for how to gather that data. This is when I started talking to them. </p>
	
<p>Based on my 23 years of practitioner experience in outcomes- and performance-based contracting, I proposed that if we want to gather this data and learn what needs doing, we must implement a whole new range of mental health services. From these, we can then derive data and learning, that could in turn be shared with others. If we want to deliver these services as effectively as possible, we must attach funding to the outcomes that the programmes deliver for the individuals accessing those services. For each individual, we want to ensure that they achieve the outcomes that they are looking for. The outcomes that we want to contract for are livelihood-linked outcomes: they will be linked to someone's life experience and social wellbeing, while allowing us to track and better understand mental health and its impacts at the same time.</p>
	
<p>Given the growing global interest in outcomes-based contracting, and since mental health is significantly under-invested globally, this should interest donors. There is a lot of interest among service providers in delivering on outcomes-based contracts, who say: “I deliver big results, pay me for that result and I will do more of it.” There is also a lot of interest among social investors willing to provide the catalytic cash or working capital; but these investors also want returns on their investments. So there needs to be someone at the end of the process who is willing and able to pay for the outcome: each time a child goes back to school; each time a person goes back to work; each time a homeless person is housed. While in some instances this could be government, in many cases, particularly in international development, there is a dearth of people willing to pay for these outcomes. The big institutions are set up to award grants and pay for inputs, not outcomes. At HBGI, we are now looking to establish and run a series of thematic outcomes funds to pool the resources of various philanthropic donors, and then use those funds to contract and pay programmes on the basis of the results that they achieve. We also want to provide technical assistance to governments or others in how to contract for outcomes and how to carry out performance management on such contracts.</p>
	
<p>An outcomes-based approach is not a cure-all. But it can help show that you can genuinely deliver an impact on individuals’ lives, and ensure that programmes are more likely to achieve results than not. This minimises the resource waste that exists in so many programmes and services, which is particularly important for low-income countries. We know that by attaching the money to the performance, we are going to increase the performance focus within that programme, minimise opportunities for fraud, and more likely increase the outcomes for the individuals accessing these services. </p>

<p class="break1">"THERE IS NO PHYSICAL HEALTH WITHOUT MENTAL HEALTH, AND THERE IS NO SOCIAL HEALTH WITHOUT MENTAL HEALTH”</p>

</div>	
	
<p>We also know that an outcomes-based approach is different from the typical fee-for-service programme which is very much one-size-fits-all: the programme is determined in advance and then people are put through that process. An outcomes-based programme, by design, is an individualised programme. If I'm looking to deliver outcomes for individuals, my service has got to be individualised; I have got to be engaging with that person and understanding their life circumstances to enable them to achieve their outcome. This means that the service itself becomes very localised and contextualised. This also means the programme is not imposing some sort of cultural understanding of mental health. Mental health varies from culture to culture in the way it's perceived, described or experienced. You need to create a service that can reflect and respond to that, rather than imposing some preconceived notion or counselling process that everybody has to  squeeze through. This is why mental health is ideally suited to outcomes-based approaches.</p>

<p class="break1">"We want to strengthen Singapore’s “social infrastructure” to make our environment more conducive for taking up healthier lifestyles.”</p>

</div>		
	
<p>Another example is the Health Promotion Board’s (HPB) Healthy Workplace Ecosystems. Through partnerships with landlords, developers, and business associations, HPB has been bringing initiatives such as mass workouts and health talks to workers in various precincts and workplace clusters, tailored to suit their needs and demographics. Today, over 80 Healthy Workplace Ecosystems have been established throughout Singapore.<sup><a href="#notestop">6</a></sup></p>	

<p>We are making an extra effort to tackle social isolation amongst seniors through Age Well SG. Social isolation, a key driver of frailty and a threat to seniors’ physical and mental health, often goes overlooked. Without the companionship of family members, friends, and the wider community, loss of function is expected to hasten. Thus, a key thrust of Age Well SG is to expand and enhance the network of AACs as nodes for seniors to remain both physically active and socially engaged. AACs create more opportunities for seniors to make friends, volunteer, and take part in active ageing programmes. For those who are enrolled into Healthier SG, AACs would be an additional supporting arm for GPs, to help seniors follow through with their health plans.</p>

<p class="break1">"We are keen to do more to lower barriers to health and healthcare, and to be more targeted in supporting not just seniors, but other vulnerable population segments.”</p>

</div>			
	
	
<p>In tandem, MOH will work with the Ministry of National Development (MND), Housing and Development Board (HDB), and Ministry of Transport (MOT) to continually upgrade homes and residential estates, as well as offer more housing options, for seniors to age independently in the community. An example of a new senior housing typology is the Community Care Apartments, which are integrated with care services. MND will also be expanding their Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme. EASE 2.0 will offer more subsidised fittings within homes so that seniors can go about their daily activities literally with greater EASE! At the same time, our HDB estates are becoming increasingly senior-friendly, with more shelters, rest points, barrier-free access ramps, pedestrian crossings, and even green man signals that last longer. </p>
	
In the coming years, we are keen to do more to lower barriers to health and healthcare, and to be more targeted in supporting not just seniors, but other vulnerable population segments. We have begun partnering with MSF in making healthcare services more accessible for lower-income households. Close to two-thirds of families under MSF’s ComLink programme have indicated having at least one family member with a chronic health condition, with a quarter of them not compliant in adhering to medical appointments or medication. ComLink family coaches and SSO coordinators will thus be working more closely with the clusters to address ComLink families’ health needs. Besides equipping the ComLink family coaches with tools to support these families through health nudges and navigation support, the respective cluster will also assign a team to provide joint case management for families with complex needs.
	
<h3>WHAT IS OUR ROLE AS A PUBLIC SERVICE?	</h3>
	
<p>The Public Service is well placed to provide the enabling infrastructure through which stakeholders from across different sectors—government, private sector, community space—can work together towards common goals. With both Healthier SG and Age Well SG, MOH is bringing in partners outside of healthcare, recognising the important roles they play in the population’s health. </p>

<p>During our public consultations for the Healthier SG White Paper in 2022, we heard from many residents that peer and family influence were key factors in motivating them to exercise regularly and eat healthily. We also saw that partners could help to introduce more variety into the types of activities that are organised on the ground. One example is the Live Well Age Well programme that HPB and the People’s Association (PA) jointly organise at various community touchpoints, which aims to empower seniors to continue doing what they love, while improving their physical, mental, and social health. In future, HPB will look at how to incorporate programmes from other public sector agencies to rejuvenate our healthy lifestyle offerings under Healthier SG and Age Well SG.</p>	
	
<p>The Silver Generation Office (SGO) will keep up its efforts to identify socially isolated seniors, and can now connect them to nearby AACs for follow-up. Over time, AACs can augment their manpower and extend their reach by broadening their volunteer pool through SG Cares, and leveraging Residents’ Networks to establish satellite locations. AIC is even working on an “Adopt-an-AAC” initiative with corporate partners, where staff can contribute to building up a more sustainable pool of volunteers for an AAC which they have adopted.</p>	
	
	
<p>Beyond the public sector, we have been actively engaging organisations in the private sector to be part of our health ecosystem. MOH and HPB adopt a tripartite approach to encouraging workplace safety and health through collaborations with corporates, unions, associations, and other public sector organisations. In July this year, we worked with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), NTUC, and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) to publish a Tripartite Statement that outlines recommendations for employers to promote employee health and wellbeing in support of Healthier SG. We are now working together to develop Tripartite Standards to guide employers in implementing practices that enhance workplace health and wellness. Today, employees can benefit from HPB’s programmes like the aforementioned Healthy Workplace Ecosystems (HWE), Mature Workers Programme (MWP), and Workplace Outreach Wellness (WOW) Programme, or the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council’s Total WSH Programme. The Tripartite Oversight Committee on WSH oversees the scaling up and sustained adoption of these programmes, to support partners' and employers’ efforts in promoting healthier lifestyles at  the workplace.</p>	
	
<p>Over the past years, HPB has also been actively engaging industry partners and steering them towards the provision of healthier options, such as reformulating their products to develop healthier food and beverages. For instance, as part of the nationwide sodium reduction strategy that was announced in 2022, HPB has been working with major suppliers to expand the range of lower-sodium salt, sauces, and seasonings. HPB also extended its Healthier Ingredient Development Scheme (HIDS) to support the development and commercialisation of lower-sodium ingredients.</p>	

<p>As a government, how we design and implement national policy is evolving. With public issues that are ever more complex and interlinked, we need the cooperation and support of many players, all doing their part to shift residents, households, and organisations in the right direction. In creating space within our policies for community and private sector partners to contribute, the public sector can become more effective as a whole in serving the needs of all Singaporeans.</p>	
	
<p>Ultimately, our initiatives must inspire individuals to themselves adopt a mindset of personal ownership, and influence others around them to do the same. This I believe is the next bound of work for us. Even with the best efforts of government and community, the agency and willingness to change lies with the individual. The design of our policies and programmes must take this into account, in order to drive lasting changes in society. </p>
