<p style="color:#F69341" class="break1">"Everything affects health, but not everybody thinks health is their problem. Yet, maybe this point of view is changing as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown how a health threat can cause massive disruption and affect most aspects of life… Through [H]ealth for All Policies, health is put at the forefront, highlighting what the health sector can do for other sectors while simultaneously attaining co-benefits for its own sector.”</p>

</div>	
	

<p>Health extends beyond our hospitals and clinics and into homes and communities. All of us have an interest in creating a healthy society for all.</p>

<p>There is a pressing need for us to improve our population’s health. Most of us are familiar with the oft-quoted statistic, that in 2030 approximately one in four Singaporeans would be aged 65 and above, up from about one in six today.<sup>2</sup> For those 65 and above, the likelihood of being hospitalised quadruples.<sup>3</sup> Furthermore, Singaporeans are already losing up to a decade of healthy life largely due to chronic conditions.<sup>4</sup> Cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and diabetes account for about 35% of our total disease burden.<sup>5</sup> Living with one or more of these conditions compromises our quality of life and increases caregiving needs. On a broader scale, they impose additional strain on our healthcare resources.</p>

<p>The good news is that our health is not fixed and can be improved, both individually and as a population. We know that an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, obesity, and tobacco use are major contributors to cardiovascular disease, cancers, and diabetes. And now, more than ever before, we have information and sophisticated tools at our fingertips to help prevent or delay the deterioration of these conditions.</p>

<p>Primary and community care providers are also crucial in supporting mental health needs. Mental health and wellbeing came to the fore during the last few years, when the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing stressors and brought about new ones. On top of ongoing efforts by community outreach and intervention teams, MOH is working with partners in primary and community care to increase mental health literacy across the population.</p>
	
<p>Our three healthcare clusters—SingHealth, National University Health System (NUHS), and National Healthcare Group (NHG)—who have traditionally built up strong capabilities in specialist medical care, acute care, and primary care—will do more in the prevention space. A big part of this involves working with community providers to integrate services and deliver more comprehensive care to residents. Over the last few years, clusters have put in place geographical-based community nursing teams, so residents can consult community nurses and receive health advice at health posts located conveniently within Active Ageing Centres (AACs), Community Centres (CCs), Residents’ Corners (RCs), and Social Service Offices (SSOs). Since 2022, we have also worked with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to pilot Family Nexus, which provides children and their families with a “one-stop shop” near their homes to access services across different domains. With Family Nexus, couples and families with young children can receive health and social support in a single session. </p>
	
<p>To facilitate the transition of patients back into the community after hospital episodes, the clusters have also been implementing the “Hospital-to-Home” programme. Post-discharge patients with complex needs are managed by a multidisciplinary care team who helps to assess their health and psychosocial needs, and follows up accordingly. </p>	
	
	
<h3>ADDRESSING UNDERLYING SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
CONDITIONS</h3>	
	
<p>Beyond preventive care, MOH is broadening our view on what factors contribute to poor health. Many of them are underlying social or environmental conditions that are much harder to address, and require concerted and coordinated efforts beyond MOH. The World Health Organisation states that health inequities are greatly influenced by “non-medical factors that influence health outcomes…the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age”. We are grateful that different Ministries across the public sector are working alongside us, to shape a Healthier Singapore for the benefit of all our residents.</p>
	
<p>Schools have been strong partners for us in laying the foundations of health literacy. Through the years, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has worked with MOH to incorporate health education in its curriculum, from early childhood all the way to tertiary education. School health programmes started being rolled out in as early as the 1930s, and have evolved over the years to stay relevant to each new generation of students. Research findings show that good health habits such as proper diet, sleep, and device use, if inculcated from young, could have a profound impact on one’s cognitive development and wellbeing later on in life. We are working with MOE and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) to roll out a more holistic school health package that will give every child a good start in fostering lifelong health habits from young. This will encompass evidence-based programmes and interventions that promote good health and address key health issues—such as obesity, screen and device usage, as well as smoking and vaping—among youth.</p>

<p class="break1">"Health inequities are greatly influenced by ‘non-medical factors that influence health outcomes… the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age.”</p>

<p>We are also harnessing the power of social connectedness in improving health and wellbeing. On top of our well-established physical infrastructure of green spaces and fitness amenities, we want to strengthen Singapore’s “social infrastructure” to make our environment more conducive for taking up healthier lifestyles.</p>	
	
One example is the Active Health Labs by Sport Singapore, which provides affordable and accessible health and wellness coaching by trained coaches. As part of Healthier SG, we are encouraging primary care doctors to refer their patients to these sorts of programmes, so that residents can get active and form new habits in a safe and supportive context.

<p>Another example is the Health Promotion Board’s (HPB) Healthy Workplace Ecosystems. Through partnerships with landlords, developers, and business associations, HPB has been bringing initiatives such as mass workouts and health talks to workers in various precincts and workplace clusters, tailored to suit their needs and demographics. Today, over 80 Healthy Workplace Ecosystems have been established throughout Singapore.<sup>6</sup></p>	

<p>We are making an extra effort to tackle social isolation amongst seniors through Age Well SG. Social isolation, a key driver of frailty and a threat to seniors’ physical and mental health, often goes overlooked. Without the companionship of family members, friends, and the wider community, loss of function is expected to hasten. Thus, a key thrust of Age Well SG is to expand and enhance the network of AACs as nodes for seniors to remain both physically active and socially engaged. AACs create more opportunities for seniors to make friends, volunteer, and take part in active ageing programmes. For those who are enrolled into Healthier SG, AACs would be an additional supporting arm for GPs, to help seniors follow through with their health plans.</p>
