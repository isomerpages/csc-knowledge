<p>In his latest Netflix documentary 
“Live to 100”, author and longevity expert Dan Buettner added Singapore as a sixth ‘Blue Zone’: a region in the world with residents who are known to live long and healthy lives. In his 2020 master class at the Global Wellness Summit,1 Buettner had argued that “the big epiphany of all these Blue Zones is that long-lasting health is very rarely successfully pursued; it ensues”. It is not genetics or willpower that boosts longevity in Blue Zones. It is a lifestyle. Then came Singapore, a Blue Zone that has been engineered, instead of emerging organically like the first five.</p>

<p>Singapore’s life expectancy at birth has been increasing and the number of centenarians has more than doubled from 700 in 2010 to 1,500 in 2020. Its healthy longevity has come from its history, culture and tradition. It has been brought about over time because of its excellent access to healthy food, good healthcare, excellent public infrastructure and social practices that mitigate loneliness, such as intergenerational gatherings. In his documentary, Buettner cited Kampung Admiralty as a feat of engineered health: it houses an indoor park, amenities, apartments, healthcare facilities, and eldercare and preschool centres next to each other. </p>

<p>Singapore leads the world on the health-related Sustainable Development Goals, according to research published in The Lancet in 2017 and part of the Global Burden of Diseases Study. The 2019 edition of the Study reported Singaporeans as living longest in the world, with a life expectancy at birth of 84.9 years and a Healthy Life Expectancy of 73.9 years, with the lowest Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) of 15,045 per 100,000 population. The study also indicated that 35% of our DALY burden could potentially be reduced by early intervention on risk factors contributed by our lifestyles.</p>	
	
	
<p>With the launch of Healthier SG, Singapore embarks on the largest ever transformation of our care system. We are encouraging residents to enrol with their primary care doctor and establish health plans to keep them well. This is an important first step towards the health of our population. Given that 80% of our total disease burden is from chronic diseases, Preventive Care is the bedrock of our Population Health Strategy.</p>
	
	
<h3>HEALTH IS FOR ALL</h3>	
	
<p>Population Health is not just about better outcomes for individuals but the distribution of those outcomes. Health is not just for the healthy or activated or those who access care. Health is for all. Health is not just for those we can see but those we cannot see. Population Health moves us from the “Story of Me” to the “Story of Us”. In doing so, we expose our vulnerabilities as a population.</p>
	
<p>Singapore has done well in addressing the social determinants of health like education, transportation, sanitation, housing and so on. With ageing, we see “new” social drivers of health, with an increase in prevalence of dementia, disabilities, frailty, and social isolation. In our centres of healthcare, we often fail to reach those we do not see until they arrive in crisis at our emergency departments. We must do better if we are to change healthcare. Our hospitals are filling up and patients are coming in more ill and with more complex conditions. There are more long stayers. They decondition during their prolonged hospital stay and most are unfit for discharge because they have greater care needs that their homes and communities cannot support. Are more beds then the solution?</p>
	
<h3>HEALTHCARE ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH</h3>	
	
<p>If we look at healthcare as a pipe, we admit and discharge, and we diagnose and treat. We look at healthcare from an efficiency lens because we want throughput and are obsessed with waiting times and bed occupancy. We were once a young population and a young country. The focus was on the iron triangle of Healthcare—Access, Quality and Cost. Hence, we centralised volume to improve quality, especially where expertise and resource was scarce, and to keep costs down. This saw the development of hospitals and specialty centres as highly efficient and specialised centres of excellence.</p>	
	
<p>In the past two to three decades, we introduced quality tools like Clinical Practice Improvement, Lean Healthcare (based on Toyota Production System) and Design Thinking to help reduce waste, improve efficiency, drive productivity and ensure a quality experience. These have served us well to ensure the pipe did not burst. When the healthcare pipe leaked due to pressure, we added resources to ensure a stronger pipe with better flow. Incentives were tied to volume to sustain increasing workload and pace</p>
	
	
<p>Today, we are no longer a young population, nor do we have the high economic growth needed to flatten the percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) we spend on health and offset the tripling of our national healthcare expenditure over the last decade. Will more of the same old paradigm give us better health and sustainable healthcare? We know that merely expanding or fixing the pipe that burst will not get us there.</p>	
	
<h3>HEALTH &amp; SOCIAL CHANGE: THREE PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFTS</h3>
	
<p>Healthier SG and the recently announced Age Well SG represent a new opportunity to change our healthcare paradigm. Age Well SG supports our seniors to age well in their homes and their communities. Singapore is projected to attain ‘super aged status’ when 21% of our population will be aged 65 years and above in 2026. So Age Well SG seeks to improve our living environment, encourage active ageing and support the care needs of our seniors in their homes and communities. We are moving beyond the iron triangle of healthcare to the triple aim of population health.</p>	
	
<p>The Triple Aim of Population Health goes beyond healthcare to achieve health outcomes for our population, improve the care experience across the system, and sustain cost per capita. In recent years, the triple aim has been expanded to the Quintuple Aim to include the wellbeing of our health workforce and health equity.</p>	

<p>To transform our current healthcare system to a population health system, I see three core philosophies taking hold:</p>
