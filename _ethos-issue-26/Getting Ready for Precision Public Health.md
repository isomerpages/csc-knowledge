<h3>NAVIGATING A CHANGING WORLD</h3>

<p>If you asked anyone in a classroom or meeting today to open up a map, chances are they would take out their phones to launch the digital map application on their devices.  But just 20 years ago, we were still using only hardcopy paper maps. Google Maps was launched in 2005, and Apple Maps in 2012. Today, digital maps are ubiquitous, and they have changed our understanding of maps as a concept, how we interact with them, and how we see the world. New ways of seeing and working have created new opportunities and jobs, new solutions, and also new problems for the current generation to solve. </p>

<p>The revolution that has taken us from hardcopy maps to digital maps bears similarities to and lessons for the ongoing transformation of the health sector. Today, people are leading longer lives than ever before—death from infectious diseases is at an all-time low and even many cancers are now curable. There are many contributing factors: advances in medical science, better health infrastructure, economic progress, improved living standards and environments, better nutrition, public health initiatives such as vaccines, improved safety culture, better education, and greater health literacy. </p>


<p>While we can be proud that many old problems have been solved, the current generation will face new challenges: widening health disparity and inequity between and within populations, new and emerging infectious diseases with the potential to cause epidemics and pandemics, increased prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases, antibiotic resistance, mental health, climate change, and planetary health. These new challenges require new approaches, new innovation, and new investments. Fortunately, we are also equipped with new enablers and tools to address these challenges.</p>


<h3>A NEW ERA OF PRECISION 
PUBLIC HEALTH</h3>

A useful way to think about this transition is to compare it with how Digital Maps built upon traditional maps to deliver a new experience and create value for the users and the system. Digital Maps are powered by the enablers of Digital Technology, Big Data science and Personalisation. In a similar way, <b>Digital Health</b> technologies, <b>Big Data</b> science and <b>Precision Medicine</b> developments are bringing about a revolution in the way we look at health at a population level.  This has given rise to the term Precision Public Health, which is the use of technology and the principles of public health to advance the health system and population health goals.

</div>

<p>Public health has and will play an important role in promoting and improving health outcomes for countries, health systems and populations. It has a strong emphasis on prevention of diseases, health promotion, advocacy for health access and coverage, enhancing people’s overall wellbeing and the many facets of public health research and evaluation. The COVID-19 pandemic, while devastating, has led to many positive changes in how health systems, researchers, providers and industry think about public health transformation. Catalysed by the pandemic, public health is experiencing a radical rethinking that is being fuelled by these three enablers that have changed the practice of public health  in many positive ways. </p>

<h4 style="color:#ED5E2A;">THREE CRITICAL ENABLERS</h4>
<p>Just as Digital Maps use large amounts of data and analytics to connect the dots, create value and be personalised to users, Precision Public Health calls for our big health data sets to be connected, analysed with advanced data science techniques, and personalised through precision medicine and personalised health. </p>
