<h3><em></em>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Singapore Public Service is
familiar with the experience of massive
and disruptive change, of which the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is but the
latest manifestation. When Singapore
attained self-governance in 1959,
and then independence in 1965, the
Public Service had to localise and reorient
itself—from its roots as part of
the colonial administration—towards
nation-building. It had to quickly
adjust to take on all the functions of
a sovereign state, doing whatever it
took to evolve into a bureaucracy that
could survive. These early experiences
in disruptive change set the foundation
for a public service that would seek
constant improvement amidst shifts
in global and local contexts.</p>

<p>Constantly building and improving
on what was done before, each past
phase of transformation has been in
the core pursuit of sustainable growth
and cohesive social development. Each
shift has been anchored by an ethos
of public service that
seeks to understand
the fears, concerns
and aspirations of
Singaporeans, strives
to constantly do better
with our people and
for our people, and
invests time and effort
to pre-empt tomorrow’s
challenges.<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup></p>

<p>These principles echo lessons gathered over 56 years of transformation efforts in
the Singapore Public Service, in seeking to remain relevant to the citizens it serves:<br>

<p>While COVID-19 has brought tremendous
disruption to the global landscape, this
article outlines how the same hardearned
lessons continue to ground
Singapore’s response to the crisis as the Public Service works to support
and bring Singaporeans as a nation
through this challenging period of
transformation, and other disruptive
challenges the future may hold.</p>

<h3>Lesson 1: Partnerships and Collaboration are the Prerequisities for Transformation</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img title="Transformation_HSK quote 1" src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_22/Transformation_HSK_Quote1.jpg" alt="Transformation_HSK quote 1">
</p>

<p style="text-align: right;" class="small-text">– Heng Swee Keat, Deputy Prime Minister<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Over the decades, the Public Service
has learned important and sometimes
painful lessons about the need to engage
citizens as partners in sensemaking and
solutioning for Singapore’s future. While
engagement in the 1960s through to the
1980s was characterised by<em> telling</em> citizens
about the pros and cons of policies and
the way forward for Singapore, a shift
to a more consulting style emerged in
the 1990s through to the 2000s.</p>

<p>Since the 2010s, as transformation in
the Public Service shifted towards “do
it together (with citizens)”, the tone of
citizen engagement correspondingly
shifted from consulting to co-creating,
reflecting a greater “partnership
between those who govern and those
who are governed”.<sup><a href="#notes">3</a></sup> This new stance
is exemplified by <em>Our Singapore
Conversation</em> (OSC)—a series of
conversations which took place from
2011 to 2013 over various platforms
and involved some 46,000 participants
from multiple sectors.<sup><a href="#notes">4</a></sup> Designed to
be more inclusive and open than prior
engagement efforts, OSC expanded
the shared space between citizens and
government, helping to build the mutual
trust needed for further partnerships
and collaboration.<sup><a href="#notes">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Likewise, the COVID-19-prompted <em>Emerging
Stronger Conversations</em> (ESC)<sup><a href="#notes">6</a></sup> initiated
in 2020 aims to increase community
partnerships and expand common spaces
in which the Government and citizens can
work together to contribute towards the
designing and implementation of policies
in complex times. The ESC serves as a
platform where citizens can share their
stories and suggest potential actions
and solutions targeted at improving
Singapore in a post-COVID era.</p>

<p>Partnerships are critical for converting
conviction into action. As issues become
more complex, the solution is not to grow
the public sector, but to grow and leverage
partnerships with people—citizens,
corporations, not-for-profits and public
officers—synthesising collective efforts in
co-authoring Singapore’s future. The
role of the Public Service is to bring
together all perspectives to facilitate
sense-making, cultivating new and
better ways of understanding a situation,
how it will unfold and what we can all
do about it.<sup><a href="#notes">7</a></sup></p>

<h3>Lesson 2: Meaningful Social Innovation Comes from Effective Partnerships and Collaboration</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img title="Transformation_DY quote" src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_22/Transformation_DyQuote.jpg" alt="Transformation_DY quote">&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="text-align: right;" class="small-text">– Dawn Yip, Coordinating Director for
SG Together, <br>
Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (Partnerships Project Office)<sup><a href="#notes">8</a></sup></p>

<p>To build a trusted, thriving and
innovative public sector, the Public
Service must engage with citizens in
more sophisticated ways. “Partnership is
also a form of continuous innovation”,<sup><a href="#notes">9</a></sup>
and public officers will find that
partnerships can offer greater access
to a wider range of ideas, perspectives
and expertise from across Singapore’s
society.</p>

<p>Building on lessons from the OSC, the
<em>SG Together </em>movement was launched
by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee
Keat in 2019 to purposefully develop
systems, structures and people that
nurture long-term relationships within
and among public agencies, stakeholders
and citizens.<sup><a href="#notes">10</a></sup> Such longer-term
relationships will facilitate even more
effective partnerships and collaboration.</p>

<p><em>SG Together </em>will complement the ideas
and connections arising from the ESC
initiative. It will also align with efforts and
recommendations from the Emerging
Stronger Taskforce (EST), announced
in April 2020. These efforts will bring
together public, private and people
(3P) sectors to ensure that economic
and social development occur hand-in-
hand as Singapore works through
the COVID-19 crisis and its impacts.</p>

<p>To ensure that these conversations
lead to action, the EST has set up
the <em>Singapore Together Alliances for
Action </em>and the<em> Singapore Together
Action Networks</em> to draw ideas from
different sectors and turn them into
real-life solutions for Singaporeans.<sup><a href="#notes">11</a></sup></p>

<h3>Lesson 3: Together with Innovation, Leadership Is Required To Have a Clear Vision of Success </h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img title="Transformation_CCS quote" src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_22/Transformation_CCS_Quote.jpg" alt="Transformation_CCS quote"></p>

<br>

<p style="text-align: right;" class="small-text">– Chan Chun Sing, Minister-in-charge of the Public Service<br>
and then-Minister for Trade and Industry<sup><a href="#notes">12</a></sup></p>

<p>The context in which leadership is
practised matters. Where it was considered
good leadership to closely direct the
Public Service’s early experiences of
transformation, today’s leaders must
be able to share a clear and inspiring
vision of success across all levels of the
system. This vision holds the potential
to enable and empower people to
reimagine the future they want and
can achieve.<sup><a href="#notes">13</a></sup> Such a shared vision is
key to developing a sense of common
purpose, ownership and motivation.
Over time, as this “ownership quotient”<sup><a href="#notes">14&nbsp;</a></sup>increases, working in partnership can
become instinctive.</p>

<p>This applies beyond the public sector.
For example, with a clear vision “to
make every senior a volunteer”, the
volunteer organisation RSVP Singapore
(RSVP) leads and initiates people-private-public partnerships to engage
seniors to serve the community. This
affords participating seniors a sense of
ownership, allowing them to become a
positive force in the community. Over
the years, RSVP has engaged about
2,500 volunteers and served more than
200,000 beneficiaries. This was done
even during the COVID-19 pandemic,
with RSVP leading virtual platforms to
conduct virtual outreach and virtual
volunteering.</p>

<p>Leadership must also help their
people connect all the small pieces
to the whole, to enable them to
“think big” and convene the efforts
of all public officers so they act as a
whole to fulfil whole-of-government
(WOG) outcomes. Leaders do this as
a part of sense-giving by looking at
issues from a higher vantage point
and providing others with a sense of
meaning or different ways of seeing.<sup><a href="#notes">15</a></sup>
For instance, in the protracted battle
against COVID-19, the Multi-Ministry
Taskforce (MTF) has consistently
reminded Singaporeans to stay vigilant
and adhere to safe management measures
even as the nation moved into later
phases of reopening. In coordinating
and managing the WOG pandemic
response, the MTF maintained laser-sharp
focus on two objectives—early
detection and ring-fencing to prevent
the transmission and formation of large
clusters. This clarity of aim helped
responding agencies cut through the
“noise” of (mis)information.<sup><a href="#notes">16</a></sup></p>

<div class="break">

<p class="break1">
Leaders must be able to manage
change effectively, as well as
rally support and involvement
from public sector staff as well
as different stakeholder groups.</p>

</div>

<p>This aspect of leadership was underlined
at the launch of the EST. In his keynote
address, Mr Heng emphasised that
the Government is responsible
for “facilitating and enabling” the
partnerships between it and the
private sector, unions, workers and
institutes of higher learning, to be able
to move quickly as a “whole ecosystem”
in order to seize opportunities.<sup><a href="#notes">17</a></sup> For
instance, the effective public-private
partnerships among companies such
as Veredus Laboratories, the Agency
for Science, Technology and Research
(A*STAR), Duke-NUS Medical School
and the like, greatly sped up the
development of a range of diagnostic
kits for detection, contact tracing and
containment efforts.<sup><a href="#notes">18</a></sup></p>

<p>To enable effective innovation in the
Public Service, “mobilisation and
movement” characterises the new
operating paradigm. Leaders must be
able to manage change effectively, as
well as rally support and involvement
from public sector staff as well as
different stakeholder groups. At the
same time, they need to be agile and
ensure that stakeholders continue
to keep the big picture in mind as
circumstances change. Singapore’s
response to the COVID-19 pandemic is
a good example of this. When the virus
was still surrounded by uncertainty,
the MTF was clear in their focus of
stopping the spread of the virus and
also ensuring that jobs were protected.
This led to the quick introduction of
clear social distancing measures, as
well as clear policies and support
measures.</p>

<h3>Lesson 4: With A Clear Vision, We Need To Have
Openness and a Growth Mindset To Drive Transformation</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">Even with a clear vision, the Singapore
Public Service must operate with
openness and a growth mindset in order
to drive transformation. The public sector
must tap on Singaporeans’ passion
and expertise<sup><a href="#notes">19</a></sup>so that it can continue
to evolve its DNA for improvement. It
must continue to seek opportunities
to grow to become the best it can be,
and then even better—as a system,
and as individual public officers who
make the system work.<sup><a href="#notes">20</a><br>
<br>
<img title="Transformation_IR quote 1" style="vertical-align: middle;" src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_22/Transformation_IR_Quote1.jpg" alt="Transformation_IR quote 1">&nbsp;<br>
</sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" class="small-text">– Indranee Rajah, Second Minister for Finance <br>
and Second Minister for National Development<sup><a href="#notes">21</a></sup></p>

<p>Adopting a growth and open mindset is
not only about strengthening the Public
Service, but also about empowering
the people sector. While the social
service sector has made much progress,
particularly in the areas of governance
and public accountability, a lack of
coordination among organisations
and volunteers has led to situations
where different beneficiary groups
have been either over-served or underserved.
This imbalance has been made
more evident by the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>By adopting an open and collaborative
stance, the SG Cares Office has pushed
for more sustainable and effective
solutions by partnering the people
sector to solve such issues. Since each
social service agency is most familiar
with the issues in “their town”, the
SG Cares Office has identified these
agencies as Volunteer Centres in each
town to promote awareness, galvanise
participation, develop volunteer
communities and offer regular and
impactful volunteer opportunities.
This approach offers a much more
effective way of connecting volunteer
efforts with beneficiaries’ needs.</p>

<p>The value of Volunteer Centres was
demonstrated during the COVID-19
Circuit Breaker period between April
and June 2020, in which many vulnerable
groups were affected by the enforced
physical and social isolation. During
this period, Volunteer Centres stepped
forward to gather needs and worked
with partners to coordinate efforts
and provide essential goods to the
vulnerable such as face masks, hand
sanitisers, food items and exercise
bands.<sup><a href="#notes">22 </a></sup>Such efforts have continued
even as Singapore moved into later
phases of safe reopening.</p>

<div class="break">

<p class="break1">
Adopting a growth and open mindset
is not only about strengthening
the Public Service, but also about
empowering the people sector.</p>

</div>

<h3>Lesson 5: For Transformation To Be Sustainable,
Empathy Is Needed To Understand Needs and To Stay Relevant</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img title="Transformation_IR quote 2" src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_22/Transformation_IR_Quote2.jpg" alt="Transformation_IR quote 2"><br>
<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: right;" class="small-text">– Indranee Rajah, Second Minister for Finance <br>
and Second Minister for National Development<sup><a href="#notes">23</a></sup></p>

<p>For transformation to be effective and
sustainable, the Public Service must
stay connected with the circumstances,
needs and sentiments of citizens. On
top of understanding the people’s
perspectives, the Singapore Public
Service must be able to engage citizens
about their concerns in a safe and
constructive space. For instance, the ESC
has indicated that, since the COVID-19
outbreak, Singaporeans have been most
concerned about issues pertaining
to social support, jobs and economy,
education and training, digitalisation
and technology, and engagement and
partnership (between government and
people).<sup><a href="#notes">24</a></sup></p>

<p>Beyond the broad labels, the Public
Service must be able to appreciate the
more nuanced dimensions of citizens’
aspirations, concerns and fears. These
include (1) maintaining the public’s
trust that the Government will not leave
them behind in the pursuit of economic
development, (2) giving assurance that
the Government will continue to support
citizens as they work hard towards a
better life for themselves and their
children, (3) involving the public as
partners in the creation of Singapore’s
future, and (4) understanding and
having empathy for the concerns of
stakeholders, including those who may
disagree on particular issues.</p>

<p>A group that the Singapore Public
Service must quickly learn to empathise
and partner with is the youth—the
generation that has the greatest
stake in the future. Purpose-driven
and willing to contribute,<sup><a href="#notes">25</a></sup> our youth
did not choose to remain bystanders
during the COVID-19 period: instead,
they took action individually and
collectively to provide assistance and
support to fellow Singaporeans who
needed a leg-up in coping with the
circumstances brought about by the
pandemic. Whether it was delivering
food to families who could not queue up
for their usual packages (e.g., delivering
meals to 500 families for Ramadan),
sewing reusable masks for those who
could not procure them (particularly
prior to the Government’s free mask
distribution exercise), leading efforts
through non-profits (e.g., Engineering
Good’s Computers Against COVID),
or even starting their own businesses
(e.g., Beng Who Cooks)<sup><a href="#notes">26</a></sup>—youths from
all walks of life invested themselves
in improving the conditions of fellow
Singaporeans even as they grappled
with their own challenges during the
pandemic. This is an encouraging
sign for Singapore’s future. The Public
Service must find constructive ways
of tapping on the energies, ideas and
passions of this new generation—within
and beyond the public sector—through
active engagement and collaboration.</p>

<h3>Conclusion: Emerging Stronger from COVID-19</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img title="Transformation_HSK quote 2" src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_22/Transformation_HSK_Quote2.jpg" alt="Transformation_HSK quote 2">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: right;" class="small-text">– Heng Swee Keat, Deputy Prime Minister<sup><a href="#notes">27</a></sup></p>

<p>The five lessons discussed above have
served Singapore well in past phases
of change, and continue to stand us in
good stead in the disruptive wake of the
COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>While the new normal brought about
by COVID-19 may be experienced as
demanding and disruptive, we need
to remember that transformation is
also natural and a necessary part of
innovation and growth. In this spirit,
Singapore cannot just aim to cope
with COVID-19. We need to emerge
stronger from this pandemic by tapping
on the opportunities that COVID-19 has
presented.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, we can become a stronger society
by <strong>quickening the pace of transformation
through technology and innovation</strong>.
COVID-19 has accelerated digitalisation
in the 3P sectors, from conducting
meetings virtually to providing services
online. To combat COVID-19, we have
also built up digital solutions such as
TraceTogether. Singapore’s response
to the crisis highlights the potential for
making better use of data collection
and greater integration of operations
and technology.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, we need to continue being
citizen-centric and business-centric in
the way that we design and implement
policies. COVID-19 has highlighted the
<strong>importance of an agile, integrated
Public Service</strong>. To manage and stabilise
the spread of COVID-19, many public
agencies worked together to enforce
safe-distancing measures, distribute
face masks and hand sanitisers, and
provide aid to the vulnerable. This
would not have been possible without
a WOG approach. We need to lock in
the mentality of working as One Public
Service so that we can serve the public
holistically.</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, we must persist in building social
resilience and unity among Singaporeans.
Singapore could not have contained
COVID-19 if everyone had not adhered
to safe management measures. Many
individuals and businesses also went
the extra mile to help the vulnerable.
This is the <strong>spirit of Singapore Together</strong>.
As we emerge from this crisis, we must
continue to partner citizens in co-creation
and provide more opportunities for all
to care for one another.</p>
