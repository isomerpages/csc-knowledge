<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Even before the global pandemic, global health has had a place at the diplomatic table alongside health security, humanitarian affairs, and social and economic development, as a significant component of foreign policy.<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup>&nbsp; And as the COVID-19 outbreak has
shown so vividly, viruses do not recognise national borders. Singapore, having faced the dire effects of the SARS epidemic first-hand, has long been aware of the need for multilateral cooperation on global health issues—including the prospect
of a pandemic.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Singapore has been an active participant in multilateral efforts—such as the US-led Global Health Security Agenda—to bolster the pandemic preparedness and response of low- and middle-income countries. It has contributed to international
programmes to provide technical and medical assistance, and helped promote global health security as a national and global priority.<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup> This is a reason why, despite being a small state, Singapore
has come to play a significant role in global health, as a knowledge and innovation hub for the control of infectious and chronic diseases.<sup><a href="#notes">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of small states and Asian societies have demonstrated best practices in managing the pandemic compared to many larger countries—particularly in areas such as diagnosis, contact tracing and health
surveillance. For instance, Singapore’s rapid development of test kits for COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic, subsequently shared globally, demonstrates how even a little red dot can contribute to countering a pandemic of unprecedented
scale.
</p>

<p>Singapore’s participation in global health diplomacy in the current pandemic can be noted on four broad fronts: (1) bilateral assistance for ASEAN member states and beyond; (2) participation in multilateral mechanisms through the ASEAN Plus platforms;
(3) participation in international efforts (G20, Belt and Road Initiative) on COVID-19; and (4) contributions to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, and UN mechanisms and processes for COVID-19 response.</p>

<p class="break1">Singapore, having
faced the dire
effects of the
SARS epidemic
first-hand, has
long been aware
of the need for
multilateral
cooperation on
global health
issues.</p>

</div>

<h3>Four Fronts of Global Health Diplomacy</h3>

<p>As a responsible small power, Singapore’s participation in multilateral and international mechanisms contributes to what Alan Chong has called “virtual enlargement”.<sup><a href="#notes">4</a></sup> This is a strategy in which small states enlarge their importance to the international community, enhancing their influence and prospects for survival and success.</p>

<h3>Bilateral health assistance: “Test-kit diplomacy”</h3>

<p>Singapore’s health diplomacy includes engaging in bilateral health assistance. Home to more than 50 biomedical companies, Singapore’s strategic investment in biomedical manufacturing has provided ballast in an economy battered by the impact
of COVID-19.<sup><a href="#notes">5</a></sup> It also afforded the city-state the infrastructure and capacity to rapidly develop diagnostic test kits in the early days of the pandemic, and then to help fulfil international
demand for kits to detect the novel virus, especially in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

<p>Fortitude Kit 2.0 was the first complete diagnostic kit to be approved and produced at scale in Singapore, and is also the most common test kit donated by Singapore’s Temasek Foundation.<sup><a href="#notes">6</a></sup> Developed
by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Diagnostics Development (DxD) Hub, Fortitude Kit 2.0’s technology can be transferred through a non-exclusive license for manufacturing to meet local and
regional demands.<sup><a href="#notes">7</a></sup>
</p>

<p>Such bilateral technology transfers engender goodwill for Singapore, at a time of uncertainty in which most high-income countries with similar capacities had been slow to act. This is part of what Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan in March 2020 termed
“test-kit diplomacy”.<sup><a href="#notes">8</a></sup> While Singapore, recognising its own vulnerabilities as a small island state, is reliant on and advocates multilateral cooperation, it is in turn also ready
to share its homegrown technological know-how for a good global cause. </p>

<div class="break">

<p class="break1">By facilitating
the global fight
to detect, treat and
protect against the virus,
Singapore also serves to
protect its own population
and accelerate an
eventual return to
normalcy.
</p>

</div>

<p>Accurate and rapid detection of the virus helps everyone: by facilitating the global fight to detect, treat and protect against the virus, Singapore also serves to protect its own population and accelerate an eventual return to the normalcy of open borders
and trade that it thrives upon. Notably, Temasek Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Temasek, one of Singapore’s two sovereign wealth funds, has earmarked S$800 million (US$563 million) for COVID-19 response, with at least S$250 million of
the earmarked funds redirected to COVID-19-related therapeutics and vaccines research and development.<sup><a href="#notes">9</a></sup>
</p>

<p>In addition to test kits, Singapore’s bilateral health assistance to support the pandemic response has also included polymerase chain reaction machines, oxygen and ventilation equipment, personal protection equipment, and hand sanitisers. While
these have mostly gone out to the nine fellow ASEAN member states, Singapore has also provided assistance to countries in Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Europe.<sup><a href="#notes">10</a></sup>
</p>

<p>These assistance efforts have also been bolstered by public-private partnerships. One such initiative was between Temasek Foundation, Singapore Airlines and the World Food Programme.<sup><a href="#notes">11</a></sup> With global
travel at a standstill because of the pandemic, the freight and flight capabilities of Singapore’s national air carrier were redirected to help deliver bilateral health assistance globally.
</p>

<p>Non-government organisations based in Singapore have also stepped in. The Singapore Red Cross channelled the Singapore Government’s seed donation of S$1 million to provide assistance to communities affected by COVID-19 in China;<sup><a href="#notes">12</a></sup> it also contributed more than S$800,000 of support for COVID-19 response to all ASEAN member states and other countries in Asia, including Timor Leste, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Maldives.<sup><a href="#notes">13</a></sup>
</p>

<p>Maintaining relationships through bilateral health assistance enables Singapore to stay relevant and preserve goodwill at a challenging time. Many of the countries that received bilateral health assistance from Singapore are source countries of its migrant
worker communities, as well as important suppliers of essential goods to Singapore. China is also one of Singapore’s key bilateral partners particularly in terms of trade and investment. Indeed, the global health-science diplomatic relations
between Singapore and China has fed into a partnership in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, treatment and diagnostics.
</p>

<p><!--page 137--></p>

<p>While there has been multilateral cooperation in infectious disease control and response between China and ASEAN in the past, Singapore and China have also signed bilateral MOUs and agreements related to global health amid COVID-19, including health cooperation,
food safety cooperation, health policy fellowship exchange, biomedical cooperation and scientific research cooperation through the Sino-Singapore International Joint Research Institute.<sup><a href="#notes">14, 15</a></sup> Such bilateral commitments further galvanise Singapore-China global health cooperation, on top of other socio-cultural and economic ties.</p>

<h3>ASEAN matters: Participation in ASEAN and ASEAN Plus platforms</h3>

<p>During the SARS and H1N1 epidemics, Singapore was active in engaging regional platforms to enact coordinated, cross-border responses. With the outbreak of COVID-19, Singapore has again been actively participating in ASEAN and the ASEAN Plus mechanisms
to develop and implement a regional response to the latest pandemic.</p>

<p>For instance, in the crucial early stages of the outbreak, Singapore was able to quickly share technical protocols and guidelines on the clinical management of COVID-19 cases (based on its global health expertise and experience of past epidemics) at the
ASEAN Emergency Operations Centre Network for Public Health Emergencies Special Video Conference in February.<sup><a href="#notes">16</a></sup>
</p>

<p>With the pandemic shutting borders and placing strain on global supply lines, Singapore has reaffirmed the ASEAN framework as vital in promoting regional cooperation to “keep trading routes and supply lines open”, particularly for essential
goods, including medical supplies and food.<sup><a href="#notes">17</a></sup> With trade being necessary for food security, Singapore has also encouraged the region to support related regional platforms like the ASEAN Plus
Three Emergency Rice Reserve to bolster the region’s food security.<sup><a href="#notes">18</a></sup></p>

<p>As one of the high-income countries in ASEAN, Singapore has also shown that it can be a dependable source of contributions for regional initiatives like the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund, to which the city-state contributed US$100,000 in November 2020.<sup><a href="#notes">19</a></sup> Singapore has also pushed for regional cooperation in the production and distribution of vaccines, citing the November 2019 ASEAN Leaders’ Declaration on ASEAN Vaccine Security and Self-Reliance.<sup><a href="#notes">20</a></sup>
</p>

<h3>Multilateralism matters</h3>

<p>Singapore’s active participation in multilateral, cross-border efforts to contain COVID-19 is consistent with its core principles of foreign policy— promoting friendly relations to protect and advance its own interests—in both global
health and economic fronts.<sup><a href="#notes">21</a></sup>
</p>

<p>At the global level—including platforms such as the G20, the Forum of Small States and the Global Governance Group (3G)—Singapore has consistently expressed its commitment to the principles of multilateralism, cooperation and interdependence
in controlling the pandemic.
<sup><a href="#notes">22, 23</a></sup> Singapore along with other members of the 3G have strongly supported the UN as a central driver in “intensified global action, cooperation and solidarity that puts people at the core
of the COVID-19 response.”<sup><a href="#notes">24</a></sup> Singapore has also advocated the key role of the WHO in directing and coordinating multilateral cooperation “to ensure that extensive immunisation against
COVID-19 remain a global public good for health”.<sup><a href="#notes">25</a></sup>
</p>

<p>A multilateral and broad-based approach to vaccination remains the best prospect for the world to be able to gradually reopen its borders to international travel—vital to Singapore’s economic interests as an open economy and travel hub. Notably,
while there have been efforts to establish safe travel bubbles (such as between Singapore and Hong Kong), implementation has been delayed by sudden surges of infections.
</p>

<p>At the 75th UN General Assembly, despite scathing criticisms of the WHO and the UN from the United States, Singapore expressed its support of the WHO’s efforts in responding to COVID-19 and in facilitating vaccine development, while also acknowledging
the need to evaluate the WHO and its processes.<sup><a href="#notes">26</a></sup> Such support reflects Singapore’s prevailing stake in multilateral institutions that are “open, inclusive and fit for purpose”
in tackling global problems.<sup><a href="#notes">27</a></sup> Singaporean leaders have urged the international community to give multilateral institutions such as the UN and WHO the “commensurate latitude, resources and mandate” to carry
out their mission for the global public good.<sup><a href="#notes">28</a></sup> Issuing a statement on behalf of ASEAN at the 75th session of the UN General Assembly in October 2020, Singapore also stated that the pandemic
was the time for countries “to double down on multilateralism” and “reaffirm commitment to a rules-based international system”, which includes supporting the UN and providing it with adequate financial resources by paying assessed
contributions in full.<sup><a href="#notes">29</a></sup>
</p>

<h3>Contributions to Global Health and Pandemic Governance</h3>

<p>As a responsible member of the global health community, Singapore has walked the talk by keeping up with its funding dues to the WHO. Singapore also increased its assessed contributions from US$4.227 million (for 2018–2019) to US$4.641 million (for
2020–2021)— and more than doubled its voluntary contributions from US$548,000 in 2014 to US$1.125 million in 2020—to support WHO health emergencies programmes and help strengthen its capacities in the Southeast Asia region.<sup><a href="#notes">30</a></sup> In March 2020, Singapore announced a contribution of US$500,000 to the WHO’s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 response.<sup><a href="#notes">31, 32</a></sup> This is beyond its assessed and specified
voluntary contributions to the WHO, which amount to US$ 6.538 million for 2020-2021.</p>

<div class="break">

<p class="break1">No one country
can be said to have
conquered the outbreak;
it is only through
solidarity in global action
that the virus and its
impacts might be
overcome.
</p>

</div>

<p>As one of very few high-income small states that can make a contribution on international platforms through global health and science diplomacy, Singapore was one of the early supporters of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and the COVID-19
Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility.<sup><a href="#notes">33</a></sup> It also co-chairs, with Switzerland, the Friends of the COVAX Facility network of supporting countries.<sup><a href="#notes">34</a></sup> In December 2020, Singapore committed to contributing US$5 million to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment mechanism, to help 92 low- and lower-middle-income countries including six ASEAN member
states (Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, the Philippines and Vietnam) to access 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.<sup><a href="#notes">35</a></sup> Singapore is also participating in the WHO-led
multi-country Solidarity Vaccine Trials, slated to begin in 2021.</p>

<p>A significant aspect of Singapore’s global health-science diplomacy is the engagement of infectious disease experts in Singapore. These include Dr Dale Fisher of the National University of Singapore, who sits on the Steering Committee of the WHO
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). Medical and public institutions in Singapore have been actively engaged not only in research and development for treatment, vaccines and diagnostics for COVID-19 but also in health communication,
battling the infodemic that has spread with COVID-19.<sup><a href="#notes">36</a></sup>
</p>

<div class="break">

<p class="break1">The pandemic
could prompt
governments to
reflect on the need
to incorporate a
health-in-all-policies
approach.
</p>

</div>

<p>Singapore has also shown solidarity with the international scientific community, by implementing pandemic response measures based on the scientific data it has contributed to building up.</p>

<h3>Prospects for Singapore and the Role of Small States in Global Health and Global Health Diplomacy</h3>

<h3>Lingering Impact on Foreign Relations</h3>

<p>COVID-19 is likely to have a lasting impact on regional and global relations. The pandemic could prompt governments to reflect on the need to incorporate a health-in-all-policies approach, and accelerate a shift towards a global health paradigm that acknowledges
and moves beyond state-centric notions of global governance. In the Southeast Asia region, the pandemic will test the ASEAN way of working through consensus and consultation, and it will retune the balance to be struck between state-led health diplomacy
and the role of non-state actors in addressing global health needs. For Singapore, health aid and cooperation will remain critical components of foreign policy for some time to come: as was the case in the aftermath of the 2003 SARS epidemic.</p>

<p>Singapore’s four-frontal approach to global health diplomacy during this unprecedented pandemic balances between two main principles. It recognises health issues as a vanguard of regional and global governance, and it harnesses strengths in health
and science to enhance regional and global influence.<sup><a href="#notes">37</a></sup> With COVID-19, Singapore has shown how a small city-state can take on effective global health diplomacy with bilateral health assistance and multilateral cooperation, while battling a pandemic,
at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Singapore does not act alone however. It recognises that there is power in numbers and that a global pandemic needs global action. No one country can be said to have conquered the outbreak; it is only through solidarity in global action that the virus
and its impacts might be overcome.</p>

<p>Singapore’s actions for global health are made in cooperation with other small states and neighbouring states, both developed and developing. It demonstrates how small states can contribute and pool their convening power, political will, leadership
and resources to address a global crisis—in the process undergoing a “virtual enlargement” of its international influence and relevance as a responsible, valuable member of the global community.</p>

<h3>Need for a More Deliberate Health Diplomacy Agenda</h3>

<p>It is hard to compare Singapore’s global health diplomacy with that of other relatively small developed countries. For example, New Zealand and Qatar might be comparable to Singapore in terms of economic power, population and size, but while New
Zealand and Qatar have dedicated aid agencies (New Zealand Aid and Qatar Fund for Development, respectively), Singapore does not. Despite this, Singapore coordinates and distributes health aid for COVID-19 response in a strategic and systematic manner,
comparable to developed countries with a vast network of distribution hubs for international health assistance. Singapore’s test-kit diplomacy, for example, was done through a whole-of-government approach, and unprecedented cooperation with
the private sector and non-profit and philanthropic organisations.</p>

<div class="break">

<p class="break1">The public sector
at large will need to
be able to discern and
understand how global
health issues inform their
country’s ability to
pursue security, trade,
development and
social progress.
</p>

</div>

<p>The need for an ongoing global health and humanitarian response could be cause for Singapore to consider developing a specific, if evolving, health diplomacy agenda. One aspect of this might be the establishment of its own aid agency. This could allow
Singapore to comprehensively respond not only to humanitarian crises in the region but also global health emergencies.</p>

<h3>Cultivating Tomorrow's Global Health Diplomats</h3>

<p>COVID-19 has illustrated how global health challenges can have a profound, cross-border impact on any country’s wellbeing. Increasingly, the public sector at large will need to be able to discern and understand how global health issues (beyond pandemics)
inform their country’s ability to pursue security, trade, development and social progress.</p>

<p>If global health concerns are to be embedded as part of public policy and foreign policy going forward, a new set of diplomatic and public sector skillsets will be needed. These should embrace, and also go beyond, both foreign policy and global health
expertise. For instance, expertise in areas such as global health ethics, global health communication and global health policy analysis will be critical for risk communication, infodemic management and global health negotiations.</p>

<p>To stay relevant to the international community, Singapore should have tangible mechanisms to systematically nurture young professionals trained in global health diplomacy—not only in Singapore but also among its Asian neighbours. This will build
mutual trust and shared expertise: enhancing the region’s propensity for and capacity to cooperate for mutual benefit, in a world increasingly beset by challenges that transcend national boundaries and capabilities.
