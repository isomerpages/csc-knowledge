<p>Given its multifaceted nature, Singapore has tackled the issue of ageing with an inter-agency approach, taking into account public inputs when deliberating policy.</p>  

<h3>1980s – ANTICIPATING NEEDS</h3>

<p>In the 80s, Singapore began to recognise that its population was ageing rapidly. A “Committee on the Problems of the Aged” (1982–1984), chaired by the Minister for Health, was formed to study the implications of an ageing population and recommend solutions to its challenges.</p>  
  
<p>One of its main recommendations was to improve society’s attitudes towards ageing and the aged. The Committee foresaw that the rapidly ageing population would require a national policy aimed at keeping every senior physically and mentally fit to continue to lead a normal, useful and active life.</p>  
  
<p>Addressing the contributions of seniors in the workforce, the Committee called for the customary retirement age to be raised from Addressing the contributions of seniors in the workforce, the Committee called for the customary retirement age to be raised from 55 to 60 (later to 65), and to raise the age for the withdrawal of retirement funds in stages. It also listed alternative employment options such as part-time work, flexi-time and work at home as a means of creating more job opportunities for seniors.<sup>1</sup></p>  
  
<p>Acknowledging that the best guarantee of care for seniors comes from the family, the 1982–1984 committee report also placed special emphasis on the need to foster filial piety among the young.<sup>2</sup></p>

<h3>1990 TO DATE – A COORDINATED NATIONAL RESPONSE</h3>

<p>In the late 90s, an Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing Population (IMC) established a coordinated national response to the challenges of an ageing society. It sought to realise a vision of “Successful Ageing in Singapore”, with a high degree of preparedness for its challenges and opportunities:</p>  

<p style="color:#939446;">We want Singaporeans to age with dignity and to remain involved in society… we must maintain a strong sense of cohesion between the generations. Singapore should be the best home for all ages.<sup>3</sup></p>
  
<p>Building on the 1982–1984 report, the IMC made a total of 78 recommendations in six key areas, viz. Social Integration of the Elderly, Healthcare, Financial Security, Employment and Employability, Housing and Land Use Policies, and Cohesion and Conflict in an Ageing Society.</p>  

<h3>UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY: “MANY HELPING HANDS”</h3>

<p>Singapore’s policies towards seniors have been guided by a principle of personal responsibility in securing well-being in one’s old age, with the family as the key pillar of support. Indeed, the 1982 Committee considered institutional care as a last resort and most “extreme measure”.</p>  
  
<p>While the emphasis on the family as primary care-giver has continued, the nature and expectations of “filial piety” have evolved in the past 10 years and can be seen in the approach established by the 1999 IMC which involves “Many Helping Hands”. The community, family and seniors must work in partnership to ensure the well-being of the aged:</p>

<p style="color:#939446;">Every individual has a personal responsibility to plan and prepare for his or her old age. The role of the family and the community is to provide the first and second line of support for those who need care and support; and the role of the State is to set out the policy framework, and provide the infrastructure and resources necessary for the other sectors to play their part.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>With the 2004–2006 Committee on Ageing Issues (CAI), a new and urgent emphasis was placed on maintaining a high quality of life for a new cohort of seniors – the baby boomers, who will reach 65 years of age by 2010. This cohort would be healthier due to rapid advances in medical science, and much more educated and economically well off than those of the 1970s and 1980s. The baby boomer generation of seniors will have highly varied needs and aspirations to be catered to, within the window of only a few years.</p>



<h3>HOLISTIC AND AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE AND ELDERCARE</h3>

<p>Singapore’s healthcare policy emphasises health promotion and disease prevention, promotes personal responsibility, and encourages seniors to remain healthy and active in the community for as long as possible. The Government has aggressively promoted healthy lifestyles and regular health screenings for early detection of illnesses to lessen the risk of major illnesses. It has also developed a strong network of community-based, step-down care services to support the family in its care-giving role. The implementation of an Eldercare Masterplan5 has resulted in more service providers offering a variety of residential, centre-based and home-based care services for seniors.</p>

<p>Healthcare in Singapore is based on access to good, affordable and appropriate healthcare for all Singaporeans, through a combination of market forces and Government intervention and infrastructure. Complementing these measures is the national healthcare financing framework, which is based again on individual responsibility, supported by Government subsidies. The Medisave national medical savings scheme, introduced in April 1984, helps individuals to put aside part of their income in personal accounts to meet future medical needs for themselves or their immediate family. MediShield, introduced in 1990, is a co-paid, low-cost insurance scheme, which helps meet medical expenses from major or prolonged illnesses that Medisave balances would not be sufficient to cover. MediFund6  is an endowment fund set up by the Government in April 1993 to help needy Singaporeans who are unable to pay for their medical expenses.</p>

<p>As part of this national framework, healthcare affordability for seniors is ensured through significant government subsidies in “Class B2” and “Class C” restructured hospital wards. ElderShield was introduced in 2002; it is an insurance scheme established to cover severe disabilities, especially at old age.</p>

<p>Healthcare and Eldercare policies also address the basic needs of the less privileged. In 2001, an Eldercare Fund was established to subsidise step-down healthcare services to the needy. Less well-off Singaporeans have their Medisave accounts topped up when the national budget permits. Through a public assistance scheme, destitute persons also receive a monthly allowance and free medical services during occasions of illness.</p>

<h3>FINANCIAL SECURITY: LIFELONG FINANCIAL PLANNING</h3>

<p>Under Singapore’s Central Provident Fund (CPF) system, individuals are responsible for planning and saving for their financial security in old age. Surveys have shown that many Singaporeans rely mainly on family support and were not prepared adequately for their financial needs in old age.</p>


<p>In recognition that family support may not be sustainable given the trend of smaller families and longer life expectancy, a “basic needs CPF model” was adopted after 1999 to cater to basic living expenses, medical and housing needs in old age. Individuals would have to make independent provisions for their desired retirement lifestyles beyond this basic level.</p>

<p>In recent years, the Government has taken steps to refocus the CPF system on its primary objectives of providing for retirement, housing and medical needs. Policy recommendations have been made to ensure more funds for retirement (e.g. increasing Special Account contribution rates when the CPF contribution rate was restored to 40%) and to enhance returns on CPF balances. A comprehensive public education programme on planning for financial security was also initiated. As a result, public awareness on the importance of preparing for retirement early has increased in the past five years.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the financial security of seniors in the near future remains a challenge. One concern is that a significant number of seniors are “asset-rich, cash-poor”. Under consideration are initiatives that would allow seniors to monetise their assets, such as reverse mortgage schemes, or helping seniors to downgrade to smaller flats or sublet their flats.</p>

<h3>EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYABILITY</h3>

<p>Having older persons employed for as long as possible keeps them healthier mentally and physically. It also integrates them more effectively in society, and enhances their financial security. Singapore will also need to tap on older workers to meet manpower needs as the workforce ages. To this end, the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers (2005) has recommended a four-pronged approach: expand employment opportunities for older workers, enhance the cost competitiveness of older workers, raise their skills and value, and shape positive perceptions towards older workers.</p>

<p>Mindsets are already changing. A recent study commissioned by the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) found that Singaporeans, unlike their counterparts in other countries, wish to continue working for as long as possible to remain financially independent. Employers in Singapore, more than anywhere in the world, actively encourage their older employees to continue working; very few companies here encourage full early retirement. More than half of Singaporean companies surveyed agreed that retirement of older workers means the loss of valuable skills and knowledge.7  This is highly encouraging for the future.
</p>






		
<p>The CPF differs from pensions in one other aspect: basic pension schemes provide all retirees with a flat rate payout, as long as they have worked for a specified number of years. As a further social safety net, targeted schemes pay a higher benefit to poorer pensioners and reduced benefits to better-off retirees. The CPF system, while self-sustaining and generally equitable across different generations, does not redistribute income in this way. Accordingly, it has limited merit in forestalling elderly poverty, since lower-income earners are less able to accumulate as much savings.</p>

<p>As more people move up the population pyramid, higher expectations and practical needs will fuel greater demand for instruments that complement and make up for the inadequacies of the CPF. As other nations have found, it may be the Government, rather than fragmented private sector services, that is in the best position to operate or facilitate such programmes with sufficient economies of scale.</p>


<h3>SUPPORTING SENIORS: A NATIONAL APPROACH</h3>

<p>Many countries have found it useful to adopt a whole-of-government approach to supporting an increasingly senior population, whose needs straddle several sectors. The “National Strategy for an Ageing Australia” is reportedly exemplary: its comprehensive mix of policies, a result of a wide participative process, addresses the multi-faceted concerns of its senior citizens.<sup>17</sup> Like Australia, New Zealand has a dedicated minister overseeing the welfare of seniors. That such resources are invested in the public services reflects the growing emphasis and importance accorded to this sector of the electorate.</p>

<p>Canada takes a slightly different approach. Its policies focus on nurturing lifelong employability of workers, instead of targeting senior citizens as a specific group. The Ministry for Human Resources and Social Development looks after all aspects of education, youth, employment and pension with the aim to “help Canadians invest in themselves to move through life’s transitions – from families with children to seniors, from school to work, from one job to another, from unemployment to employment, from the workforce to retirement”.<sup>18</sup></p>
  
<p>Population ageing is not limited to developed nations. The most serious challenges will likely be faced by developing countries, which have yet to build a sound economic base to withstand the economic impact of a greying society. Literature shows that early intervention offers the best chance of success in influencing population trends. Singapore is in an advantaged position – it is not caught in the pension trap and its fiscal health allows it to prepare adequately for an impending demographic shift. It should therefore be able to restructure successfully to meet the challenges of an ageing population –if it acts in good time.</p>
