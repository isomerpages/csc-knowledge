<h3>Data Matters</h3>  
  
<p>Technology and data have the capacity  
to make what is happening in a city  
more apparent, but they can also make  
things less visible. Very often, data can  
tell us that something is happening,  
but it may not tell us why. Even as data  
makes something more evident, it may  
also suggest other elements we have  
yet to uncover. For data to support the  
pursuit of more liveable and sustainable  
cities, we need to look at both sides: we  
need to be clear what is being made  
visible, and what is being made invisible.</p>  
  
<p>This is where integration becomes  
important: bringing together big data,  
small data and thick data, across siloed  
boundaries. It is only in combining  
these that we can begin to see the fuller  
picture of things as a system and are  
better able to make the right decisions and set the right policies.</p>  
  
<p>This also involves not just looking  
at outputs and outcomes, but also  
identifying and understanding the  
processes that are leading to them,  
and understanding what it all means  
in terms of how people live and the  
impact on their lives.</p>  
  
<p>This is an aspirational ideal that everyone  
is striving for, but no city can be said  
to have fully mastered it. The relevant  
question is whether we are taking  
concrete steps towards it, and whether  
we have the prerequisites to do this well.  
These prerequisites include the will to  
organise data and to use it for good and  
being system-oriented in approach. In  
these regards, Singapore looks to be  
in a good position, given our history  
and track record. How can Singapore  
build on these strengths to embed and  
deepen a strong data culture?</p>

<h3>What Makes for A Healthy Data Culture</h3>  
  
<p>A healthy data culture is one which  
understands that data comes from all  
perspectives and directions. It is about  
pulling all kinds of data together—whether  
descriptive, predictive, modelling,  
quantitative or qualitative—and asking:  
“How do we decide what to weigh or  
prioritise? And given the totality of the  
insights, how do we make good analyses  
and decisions?” A good data culture  
has the capacity to understand what  
the right balance between all these  
considerations is.</p>  
  
<p>It is also important to understand both  
the limitations as well as the possibilities  
of data. A healthy data culture also  
calls for the humility to say that the  
more the data tells us, the more we  
don’t know and need to find out. This  
may also mean what we know today is  
correct now, but it may not be correct  
tomorrow. To adapt a phrase from the  
Institute of the Future, we should have  
strong beliefs, weakly held. We need  
to have convictions about our analyses,  
but be open to changing our minds  
when new data comes in.</p>  
  
<p>A vital part of data culture is having an  
iterative, feedback loop. This means that  
it is important to make a constant, daily  
effort to improve. One of the things  
we tell foreign delegations who come  
to Singapore is that the solutions and  
successes they see took us decades to  
get to. It was the outcome of people  
at all levels working conscientiously,  
assiduously, day in, day out, to just  
make things better; to make a city more  
liveable day by day. Sustaining a city  
is a long game.</p>  
  
<p>This also means changing course, or  
policies, when the data calls for it.</p>  
  
<p>A healthy data culture is about not  
judging people on the rightness of  
their decisions alone, but also how they  
react once they realise they have made  
a mistake. The latter tells you about  
their capacity to change, which means  
that even if they get things wrong, they  
will eventually get it right. Just as with  
driving, sometimes, you may need to  
make a U-turn because you realise you  
need to go the right way. And changing  
course is better than keeping to the  
wrong direction, or worse, crashing.  
Besides, going the wrong way initially  
can sometimes lead you to discover  
new places.</p>

<h3>Nurturing A Data Culture for Urban Sustainability</h3>  
  
<p>There are a number of ways to facilitate  
a conducive data culture. One is to  
encourage a willingness to experiment,  
with the capacity to accept that not all  
experiments will succeed: some will fail,  
but the important thing is to keep trying  
because there will be new data points, new  
technologies, new techniques, different  
ways of stacking the data, and different  
ways of interpreting the data. If we do  
not keep trying, we will not develop the  
muscles to be able to do better in future  
when something new arises.</p>  
  
<p>Look at social media platforms: whenever  
new ones emerge, people try them out  
and come up with interesting ways of  
using them. This has to do with the  
nature of data and digital technology at  
large: it is general purpose, which means  
that it can be appropriated to achieve  
many different outcomes. Digital data  
is an intangible sort of capital, which  
means we must expect the unexpected,  
both positive and negative. If you don’t  
experiment and you think you can sit  
down and write out all the potential uses  
and outcomes, you will miss out on all  
the other ways it could be used. So, we  
need to leave room for experimentation,  
within the public sector as well as in the  
private and people sectors.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
The more the data tells us, the more we don’t know and need to find out.  
</p>  
  
</div>  
  
<p>We also need to always ask ourselves,  
that given all the data we collect and  
the analyses we do: what does it mean  
for the individuals at the end of it? We  
need to always link back to something  
that benefits people, so that they feel it is  
meaningful to them. For instance, one of  
our industry fellows working in Shenzhen  
took the basic GPS data already available  
to officials—data that had been collected  
but not used—and, with a simple matching  
of supply and demand, was able to help  
taxi drivers increase their revenue. He  
also looked at the electric vehicle (EV)  
charging infrastructure and realised that  
instead of charging them for a few hours  
to get to 100%, EVs could be charged  
for just an hour with enough charge  
most of the time—which meant queues  
for charging points could be shortened,  
and the charging infrastructure could  
be optimised.</p>

<p>Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities adjunct fellow Dr Andy Zheng<sup>1&nbsp;</sup> worked with a team of researchers along with PAIR CITY, a big data company, on a number of innovations to benefit taxi  
drivers in the city of Shenzhen, China.</p>  
<h3 class="boxheader">Matching Taxi Supply with Demand</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Real-time supply-demand data (already collected by the city government) was provided to taxi drivers, improving their efficiency and earnings by 8% while also reducing passenger wait times in hotspots that often faced a taxi shortage.</p>  
<h3 class="boxheader"> EV Charging</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>EV taxi drivers, carrying over petrol car routines, used to charge their EVs to 100% so they could change shift with a full tank. This led to long queues at charging stations near shift-changing locations. The researchers and PAIR CITY were able to show that most of the time, only 70% of the charge was needed for the night shift. EV taxi drivers therefore only needed to charge their taxis for less time, at any station wherever and whenever was convenient (e.g., during their lunch break). This greatly reduced  
queues and saved the drivers time which could be used to increase earnings or to rest. It also improved the overall use of the charging network without requiring more infrastructure to be built.</p>

<h3>Making a Material Difference with Data</h3>  
  
<p>Another aspect of building a data culture  
is to develop the right talent: we need  
enough people who can do what is  
needed to get involved. Our research  
has found that in the digital age, one’s  
ability to master something and to be  
good at it depends on the interactions  
that we have.</p>  
  
<p>Nobody has all the expertise needed,  
so you must complement your own  
skills with those of people from other  
disciplines, as well as those from other  
backgrounds and generations, because  
they have different perspectives and  
understand the system differently.  
For instance, in a power plant or large  
infrastructure facility, someone who’s  
only been in the control room looking  
at data will have a very different view  
from someone who has had to walk  
the facility, knock the pipes and smell  
the place.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
We need to always link back to something that benefits people, so that they feel it is meaningful to them.  
</p>  
  
</div>  
  
<p>Data culture is not just about whether you  
understand the statistics, but whether  
you can relate the numbers to what is  
happening on the ground. In the same  
vein, the nursing schools have said  
that it is easier to get someone with a  
nursing background to pick up health  
informatics and know what the data  
means, than it is to get a data scientist  
to understand what nursing is about.</p>  
  
<p>The design of these technologies,  
down to what kind of gauge or display  
is used and how people interact with them,  
also matters. Is your data infrastructure  
in fact helping you to understand what  
is going on? We need people who not  
only understand the technology and  
the data, but also how all these line up  
at the systemic level, and then what it  
means at a material level.</p>  
  
<p>After all, a city is a cyber-physical setting.  
It is not just made up of digital data or  
technologies. It is made up of people,  
infrastructures, cars, roads, trees and so  
on. The ability to operate at the interface  
between the cyber and the physical, and  
to traverse them, becomes quite critical.</p>  
  
<p>The risk is that sometimes we want  
something to happen, but it is not felt  
on the ground. And when it isn’t felt,  
it becomes harder to convince people  
to change. It is already inherently  
challenging on issues of climate change  
and sustainability, where what we need  
to do today will only show benefits in  
the future. It’s a long game. But all the  
more, it becomes important to find those  
gradations and small improvements that  
people can see and feel on a regular basis.</p>  
  
<p>This is where Singapore can take the  
lead. Never in history have we been able  
to gather, store and analyse data like  
we are able to today. And if there’s any  
place that can pull all the data at different  
levels together in a meaningful way, it  
is Singapore. To do this well requires  
a certain administrative ability as well  
as the will to organise towards policy  
outcomes and public benefits.</p>  
  
<p>Our public sector can be a role model  
for the data culture that we want to see  
in the rest of Singapore. It can show  
that it is open to experimentation; that  
it trusts but verifies data; that it has  
strong beliefs but is prepared to let go  
of them once the data shows otherwise,  
and that it can do this in a way that is  
mature and sophisticated. We should  
remember that at the end of every data  
point is a human being. The task is to  
try and make that human being’s life a  
little bit better all the time.</p>
