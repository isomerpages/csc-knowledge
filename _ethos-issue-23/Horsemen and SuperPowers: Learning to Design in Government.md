<h3>DESIGN’S TRANSFORMATIONAL SUPER-POWER</h3>  
  
<p>The Singapore Public Service has had  
a longstanding reputation of efficiency  
and customer service. We have been at  
the forefront of e-government services,  
referenced heavily from private sector  
management frameworks and principles,  
and have undergone decades of process  
improvement methods such as Six  
Sigma and Kaizen.</p>  
  
<p>By the time I was tasked to develop  
public sector innovation and service  
approaches in the Prime Minister’s  
Office in 2009, there were very little  
efficiency gains left to be squeezed  
out of the system.</p>  
  
<p>We were also experiencing the tensions  
and limitations of frameworks and  
principles adopted from the private  
sector around customer service. The fact  
is that, as government, we don’t choose  
our customers. The act of governing is  
about seeking the best compromise:  
you cannot make everyone happy.</p>  
  
<p>The ‘aha’ moment came when I visited a  
Ministry’s new service centre, co-designed  
with IDEO. While others on the same  
tour probably saw a very lovely space,  
I saw something completely different:  
I saw transformed civil servants.</p>  
  
<p>These were former colleagues, with  
whom I had once written rules which  
were sometimes kept deliberately  
opaque to prevent people from ‘gaming  
the system’. Implementation of these rules required convoluted processes.  
And as ‘typical civil servants’, we had  
been afraid of getting ‘feedback’ from  
the public, because they invariably  
were complaints.</p>  
  
<p>Except now during that particular  
visit, these same ex-colleagues were  
saying things like: “we want to be  
transparent about our processes”,  
and “we want people to feel guided in  
meeting their goals”, and “we need to  
trust our customers if we want them  
to trust us”, or “we need to talk to the  
public to understand their experience  
from their eyes”. I asked myself: <em>what  
happened to them</em>?</p>  
  
<p>Design happened to them.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
They learnt to listen to people's  
stories and search for meaning  
behind those experiences. They  
came to view their customers  
as partners in achieving the  
same goals, not as adversaries.  
Most of all, they learnt to let  
go of fear<em>.

<div class="containerbox">  
  
  
<h3 class="title">The Power of Design</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>The sheer breadth of what  
is considered design and  
how it affects our lives is  
mind-boggling—everything  
from how we use everyday  
products like a hair dryer,  
how we access key services  
like healthcare and education,  
how we buy things online,  
how spaces make us feel, and  
how we express ourselves  
through what we wear.</p>  
<p>Design is simply everywhere.</p>  
  
  
  
</div>  
  
  
  
  
  
<p>This Ministry had used the design thinking  
process to conceptualise the service  
centre, thinking from people’s needs  
first and space second. They learnt to  
listen to people’s stories and search  
for meaning behind those experiences.  
They came to view their customers as  
partners in achieving the same goals, not  
as adversaries. Most of all, <em>they learnt to  
let go of fear</em>: the same fear I see holding  
back so many well-intentioned attempts  
at change and innovation.</p>  
  
<p>Right then and there, I realised that  
in order to transform public sector  
outcomes, we needed to first transform  
our public officers. Design is not just  
about the outcomes, although they are  
important. Design is a mindset; a way of  
thinking and behaving around problems  
that puts people first.</p>  
  
<p>I was convinced that we needed to  
implement design thinking in the  
public sector. My team and I tried many  
things: we commissioned a series of  
experiments using design thinking in four  
policy areas—to very limited or even no  
success (more on that later). We wrote a  
manifesto which was shared with public  
sector leadership about how to become a  
citizen-centred public sector. We visited  
MindLab in Denmark and NESTA in the  
UK. In 2011, we set up the Singapore  
public sector’s first in-house design  
lab, and hired designers into the Public  
Service. Back then, very few people had  
heard of design thinking. We had to do a  
lot of education and awareness-raising.</p>  
  
<p>It felt fantastic, it felt revolutionary. We  
felt like a small ragtag group of people  
trying to change the world through  
design. But we fell short of the impact  
we had thought we would achieve.</p>  
  
<p><em>Why</em>?</p>  
  
<h3>LESSONS LEARNT: THE FOUR HORSEMEN  
OF DESIGN DEATH IN GOVERNMENT</h3>  
  
<p>The problem is that ‘improved user  
experience’, the Super-Power of  
design thinking, is insufficient <em>on  
its own </em>to overcome many of the  
wicked and complex problems that  
governments face.</p>  
  
<p>In business, if you can improve your  
customers’ experience over your  
competitor, identify and serve previously  
unmet needs, or refine existing offers  
for new markets with new behaviours,  
the market will reward you. Improving  
user experience is a strong premise for  
innovation. This premise further rests  
on three grounds on which businesses  
function: one, as long as the new idea  
has commercial value, you go for it. Two,  
having proven your business case, you can  
assemble teams, make new hires, invest  
in technology and start development.  
Three, the moment the idea stops making  
money, you can discontinue it. In other  
words, design thinking in the private  
sector depends on an unambiguous goal  
(profit), a <em>tabula rasa</em> for implementation,  
and a clear exit strategy.</p>  
  
<p>But governments deal in a very different  
space. After a decade of observing  
countless design projects in government,  
I have discerned a clear pattern for why  
design thinking does not work the same  
way for governments as it does for  
businesses. I call this the Four Horsemen  
of Design Death: <em>Trade-offs</em>, <em>Disruption</em>,  
<em>Committees</em>, and <em>Grandfathering</em> (not  
what you think it means).</p>  
  
</em><div class="break"><em>  
  
</em><p class="break1"><em>  
The problem is that ‘improved  
user experience’, the Super-Power of design thinking,  
is insufficient on</em> its<em> own to  
overcome many of the wicked  
and complex problems that  
governments face.  
</em></p><em>  
  
</em></div><em>  
  
<p>First, on goals. Governments deal in the  
space of multiple and sometimes conflicting  
policy objectives. Would climate-friendly  
policies increase business costs and  
reduce competitiveness? Would stronger  
social safety networks reduce motivation  
to work? Is levelling the playing field  
the right approach towards improving  
social mobility? A business can hone in  
on a target market and decide whose  
experience they want to improve. But  
for governments who must rightfully  
serve all, whose experience do you seek  
to improve, especially if it might mean  
that one group wins and another loses?  
The first Horseman of Design Death is  
<strong>Trade-offs</strong>, the key reason why our policy  
experiments using design thinking did  
not quite pan out. After all, policy is tthe  
art of navigating trade-offs.</p>  
  
<p>Then let’s look at implementation.  
Governments operate with legacy systems  
in policies, technology, HR, finance and  
procurement. A new idea, or even worse,  
a <em>disruptive</em> idea, does not carry the same  
connotation as in the business world.  
There is nothing cool about disruption in  
government. You are not disrupting the  
competition, you are only disrupting yourself,  
as well as the key essential services that  
millions of people have come to depend  
on. You do not want to be known as the  
government who said, “We are disrupting  
schools tomorrow!” Stability is prized  
above all else. <strong>Disruption</strong> is the second  
Horseman of Design Death.</p>  
  
<p>Implementation also depends on other  
stakeholders willing to change how they do  
things. These could be other departments,  
other agencies, non-governmental  
players, or simply the public. The project  
team does not have direct control of  
the stakeholders, but can only seek to  
influence and persuade, usually through <strong>Committees</strong>: the third Horseman of Design  
Death. They suck up time and energy,  
are usually outside the core work of the  
secretariat, and sprout like mushrooms  
but are notoriously hard to close down,  
even long after their reason for being  
has lapsed.</p>  
  
<p>Finally, let’s look at exit. Businesses can pull  
products, services or teams out of market.  
But a government can’t simply shut down  
an aid programme, an IT system, or an  
agency overnight because ‘it didn’t quite  
work out’. I have been involved in closing  
off government programmes before,  
and it actually takes longer than setting  
new ones up. Meet the final Horseman of  
Design Death: <strong>Grandfathering</strong>. It means to  
transition a set of people under old rules  
and processes while implementing a new  
system with new rules. The greatest fear  
of civil servants in implementing a policy  
change is the nightmare of managing a  
spaghetti tangle of rules, processes and  
systems for different sets of people. You’d  
be surprised at how many seemingly minor  
exceptions have to be managed through  
manual processes. Grandfathering means  
that even as a civil servant is considering  
a new programme, he is already thinking  
about how he would have to carry the  
can long after it fails.</p>  
  
<p>Hence, the clarion call of Design, of the  
‘improved user experience’, simply does  
not carry the same pull in government.  
And this is not because we don’t care  
about people’s experiences, but because  
there are other important things at stake.  
Valiant teams have tried design thinking  
but stumbled over the implementation  
of ideas. One of the key refrains is: “The  
idea is great, but we just can’t implement  
it”. At other times, design doesn’t even  
get its foot through the front door. With  
all the risks associated with change and  
unclear benefits, the desire to improve  
user experience just doesn’t make the  
priority list.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
Implementation depends on  
other stakeholders willing to  
change how they do things.  
</p>  
  
</div>  
  
<h3>DESIGN ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH</h3>  
  
<p>I still believe in the transformational  
power of design: that it can create  
impactful outcomes for citizens, and  
that it can help the Public Service  
become more responsive and resilient.  
I’ve also learnt that the Four Horsemen  
can be overcome—provided certain  
other conditions are in place.</p>  
  
<p>First, there has to be a really clear,  
rational and justifiable case for why a  
government prioritises the needs or  
experiences of some users, especially if  
it involves a trade-off against another.  
The most compelling cases I’ve seen  
are those that say:<strong> improving the  
experience for this group now will help  
us hedge against some problematic  
but undeniable long-term trends</strong>.  
Demographic shifts, climate change,  
technology breakthroughs, and social  
attitudes are all examples of forces  
affecting the government’s operating  
environment, which are difficult to  
influence or reverse. Businesses call these  
market studies; in government we call it  
futures thinking: the research and study  
of long-term drivers and forces, critical  
uncertainties, and potential scenarios.</p>  
  
<p>When I directed the Land Transport  
Authority’s transformation efforts, the  
CEO at that time explained that design  
was critical because Singapore was  
short on land and we could not continue  
building roads for cars. Public transport  
simply could not compete against the  
sex appeal and status of cars and hence  
needed to be loveable, not just cheap  
and accessible. In another example, the  
Defence Science and Technology Agency<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup>  
invested heavily in design innovation  
capabilities for its engineers because  
Singapore’s declining citizen population  
meant that there will be fewer national  
servicemen in the future, and hence  
any technology has to be intuitive to  
use. GovTech’s LifeSG was conceived to  
address Singapore’s declining population,  
aiming to support young adults’ coming  
of age and navigating parenthood.<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup>  
When design supports long-term thinking, it  
has the greatest chance of disarming  
the Horseman of Trade-Offs. It may  
even make Grandfathering bearable,  
and Disruption worth considering.</p>  
  
<p>Second, designers in government must  
see their job not as designing one single  
beautiful solution, but a set of solutions  
across different parts of the system.  
This inevitably involves compromises  
to the original design ideas. While  
each individual solution might not be  
as sexy or revolutionary as desired,  
they may together form a coherent  
set of interventions to tip the system  
towards a new state. In other words,  
design thinking meets systems thinking.  
IDEO.org’s Theory of Change model is  
very relevant for this.<sup><a href="#notes">3</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>A good designer in government is a  
systems designer. He or she must  
understand the critical stakeholders in  
the delivery system, which piece of the  
puzzle they each hold, their inherent  
motivations, and what will spur  
collective action. <strong>The job of designer in  
government is as much about the  
quality of conversations as the quality  
of solutions</strong>. The key tools of a designer  
here are reflecting aspirations (<em>why is  
this important to the collective us?</em>),  
finding common ground amid different  
perspectives, searching for exceptions  
(people who are already managing  
the problem in new effective ways),  
and helping stakeholders navigate  
one another. This holds true whether  
we are talking about balancing trade-offs or coordinating implementation  
across agencies.</p>  
  
<p>As challenges get more complex, the  
alliance-building aspect of a designer  
will only get more important, and this is  
not just restricted to government. The  
recent Emerging Stronger Taskforce  
Alliances for Action are perfect examples  
of alliance-building conversations at  
industry or even cross-sectoral scale.<sup><a href="#notes">4</a></sup>  
The topics covered by the Alliances on  
the future of robotics, smart commerce,  
ed-tech, and sustainability (to name a few) were the perfect foil for design,  
and indeed designers were involved in  
some of the innovation sprints. However,  
the designer is not only designing just a  
solution or service to grow new markets,  
but also a business case that represents  
a new form of organising relationships  
or supply chains. If designers lack  
the systems mindset, even the most  
exciting commercial ideas could not be  
implemented in this alliance context.</p>  
  
</em><div class="break"><em>  
  
</em><p class="break1"><em>  
Designers in government must  
see their job not as designing  
one single beautiful solution,  
but a </em>set of solutions<em> across  
different parts of the system.  
</em></p><em>  
  
</em></div><em>  
  
<h3>ADDRESSING COMPLEX CHALLENGES WITH DESIGN</h3>  
  
<p>There are many instances where design  
thinking delivers an important impact  
to public sector outcomes. I find that  
design works best when it is applied to a  
contained moment of interaction between  
the government and the public. There are  
many great examples in Singapore of this:  
the HDB Service Centre at Toa Payoh,  
Ministry of Manpower’s Employment  
Pass Service Centre, Khoo Teck Puat  
Hospital, and even the Family Courts  
have all used design thinking to create  
a supportive environment for users. The  
most important outcome from design  
is relational; we are not just making  
essential services more efficient, but also  
providing assurance and improving trust  
between government and citizens along  
the way. This trust credit is what gives  
strength to our social fabric. It allows  
us as a nation to rally together during  
tough times like the COVID crisis. This  
alone makes design extremely important  
for governments.</p>  
  
<p>But in order for design to have a true  
impact on the wicked, complex problems  
that governments have to solve—climate  
change, helping small businesses stay  
competitive, improving social services,  
preserving arts and heritage, transforming  
industries, reinvigorating communities—  
design has to be used in tandem with  
Futures Thinking and Systems Thinking.  
While we can pursue each domain as a  
separate line of enquiry, eventually we  
have to bring the answers together to  
gain clarity about the complex problem  
at hand.</p>  
  
<p>In addition, we should use the tools of  
design—deep human understanding,  
storytelling, ideation—to support Futures  
and Systems. Good conversations are  
the channels through which we build  
collective intelligence and drive collective  
action. This is a fundamentally different  
dynamic from that of Committees, which  
tends to be: “I want to achieve this goal  
so please change what you are doing.”  
Instead, the Design dynamic is: “What  
do we understand about this challenge?  
What are we trying to achieve together?”  
This is essential for managing complexity.</p>  
  
<p>In short, the key to learning how to  
design the future involves:</p>  
  
<p>(1) Knowing what questions design can  
and cannot answer; and</p>  
  
<p>(2) Using tools of design for conversations<br>

<h3 class="title">Balancing Future, Systems and Humans in Tax Collection</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>TThe Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) is a prime example of hitting  
the bull’s-eye between Future, Systems and Humans. What initiated IRAS’s digital  
push for e-filing way back in the 1990s was actually a very central realisation of  
Humans—that the vast majority of people actually wanted to pay taxes and not  
run afoul of the tax authority. Hence, IRAS set out to make it as easy as humanly  
possible to pay taxes. This involved key stakeholders like employers submitting  
income information back-end to IRAS so that taxpayers did not have to even  
declare their income statements (Systems). Why? As Singapore is a small country,  
fiscal discipline will always be an important factor for our survival (Future).</p>  
<p>IRAS may not have thought of what they were doing back in the 1990s as  
design, but it is essentially a very human-centred mindset, coupled with a clear  
eye on the future and a rigorous systems approach. When civil servants take on  
complex challenges, whether through approaches called design thinking, digital  
transformation, or community engagement, they must make sure they are always  
addressing the whys and hows of Future, Systems and Humans.</p>  
  
  
  
</div>  
  
  
  
  
  
<h3>EPILOGUE: LEARNING FROM THE FRONT ROW</h3>  
  
<p>In my career in the Public Service, I have  
enjoyed a front row seat to the evolution  
of design thinking in the Singapore  
Government for over a decade. Today,  
I estimate that there might be thirty-plus in-house design capabilities spread  
across the Singapore Government.</p>  
  
<p>They call themselves different names  
like Customer Experience or Digital  
Transformation, but the design thinking  
mindset is core to their way of working.  
Some have even hired professional  
designers. Public Service leaders are also  
much more exposed to and supportive  
of design thinking.</p>  
  
<p>In speaking with many of my public  
sector colleagues, I know they still  
need support to overcome the Four  
Horsemen. I suspect that they are going  
through the same emotional journey as  
I went through years ago: starting of  
fully inspired by the power of design,  
and then becoming deflated bit by bit  
along the way when the impact did not  
live up to the potential. We need to help  
them and others overcome the learning  
curve of how to use design to its fullest  
impact in government. Frameworks and  
tools are just the surface. Design is not  
something that you do; it is the way that  
you think and behave.<sup><a href="#notes">5</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>My aspiration is to help build design  
muscle memory for approaching complex  
problems.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
The most important outcome  
from design is relational; we  
are not just making essential  
services more efficient, but  
also providing assurance  
and improving trust between  
government and citizens  
along the way.
