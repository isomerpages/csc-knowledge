<em><small>ETHOS Issue 23, October 2021</small></em>

<p>Learning, education, adaptation and  
application have been key drivers  
of progress in Singapore’s journey  
from independence to a modern city-state. In supporting and furthering  
Singapore’s success, the Public Service  
has strived to become ever more  
attuned, aligned and able in meeting the  
needs of a rapidly developing nation.  
Over the decades, the Civil Service  
College (CSC) and its predecessors  
have prepared generations of civil  
servants to serve with excellence,  
integrity and a strong ethos for the  
public good, even as the demands  
of nation-building grow ever more  
sophisticated and complex. In the  
process, our agencies of learning  
have become agencies for change:  
tasked not only with keeping our  
public officers abreast of the latest  
technologies and techniques of sound  
public administration, but also shifting  
deep-seated mindsets—towards more  
citizen-centred, whole-of-government  
thinking, for instance. In the two  
decades since its formation as a  
statutory board, <a href="/ethos-issue-23/civil-service-college-preparing-the-public-service-for-the-future/">CSC has been an important platform for advancing the Public Service</a>: beyond doing good  
work today, to making the work of  
tomorrow possible.</p>  
  
<p>But what should we learn to be ready  
for the future? As the COVID-19 crisis  
has taught us, an interconnected world  
is also one increasingly beset by rapid  
and often bewildering change, in which  
there is far less certainty about what  
is to be done. While a firm foundation  
of core technical competencies will  
always be needed, we must also  
master meta-skills that will stand us in  
good stead in fluid circumstances. We  
must <a href="/ethos-issue-23/learning-for-the-future/">learn how to learn, relearn, and unlearn as the situation requires</a>;  
get comfortable with ambiguity and  
differences; find strength in partnering  
with colleagues, partners, and fellow  
Singaporeans. The future of learning  
lies not in knowing more, but in seeking  
to know. This calls for<a href="/ethos-issue-23/metaphors-mental-models-updating-our-language-for-public-sector-learning/"> fundamentally different ways of looking at learning,and at ourselves</a>.</p>  
  
<p>Profound changes in the socio-economic  
landscape—including disruptive  
technologies and work-life patterns (as  
we have seen in the pandemic), as well  
as in the way we relate to one another  
both within and outside work—are  
prompting <a href="/ethos-issue-23/the-future-of-learning-and-development-in-the-singapore-public-service/">a rethink of what, how and when we learn, and even who the learner is</a>. Now that we are passing  
the culture shock of going digital, the  
practical <a href="/ethos-issue-23/breaking-down-barriers-in-blended-learning/">experience gained in working with these new approaches should deepen and inform our learning strategies</a>. These and other forthcoming  
technologies will bring new opportunities  
to enhance capabilities, enrich learning  
and empower our people.  
The <a href="/ethos-issue-23/nurturingfutureleadersadaptingleadershipdevelopmentapproaches-to-a-changing-context/">success of future leadership</a>&nbsp;could  
depend on the degree to which leaders  
can catalyse effective learning in their  
teams and organisations, by providing  
the conditions and impetus for it to take  
place, even during—or better yet, ahead  
of—unsettling times.</p>  
  
<p>There is growing awareness that  
learning does not happen in silos—that  
it is a social, embodied and holistic  
process rather than an individual and  
purely cognitive procedure. This has  
led to renewed interest in <a href="/ethos-issue-23/engaging-hearts-and-minds-a-conversation-about-learning-experience-design/">designing environments and experiences  
better&nbsp;suited to learning</a>. An important  
aspect of this appreciation for how and  
where learning occurs is the movement  
towards <a href="/ethos-issue-23/employability-growth-and-resilience-through-workplace-learning/">workplace learning</a>,  
by which <a href="/ethos-issue-23/thinking-differently-about-workplace-learning/">theoretical knowledge and applied wisdom can co-develop, iterate, and lead to practical benefits and new insights, for learners as well as their organisations</a>. It is  
in <a href="/ethos-issue-23/horsemen-and-superpowers-learning-to-design-in-government/">engaging with the complexities of real-world needs and challenges</a>&nbsp;that learning finds its purpose  
and hones its meaning—when we  
approach the process with curiosity,  
discipline, openness, and an instinct  
for the greater good.</p>  
  
<p>May you find inspiration, and something  
to learn, in this issue of ETHOS!</p>
