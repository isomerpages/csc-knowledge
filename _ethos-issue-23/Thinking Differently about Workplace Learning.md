<h3>WHAT IS WORKPLACE LEARNING?</h3>  
  
<p>Understandings about workplace  
learning (WpL) vary. In addressing  
some basic but critically important  
questions about WpL—what is it, what  
does it ‘look’ like, how do we know  
learning is taking place—we need to  
examine commonly held assumptions  
about WpL.</p>  
  
<p>Some 11 years ago, when I first started  
asking policymakers, industry people  
and adult educators in Singapore  
what they understood WpL to be, a  
common response was that it is mainly  
on-the-job training. While the general  
understanding of WpL has become  
much more sophisticated since then, it  
is still quite common to hear many say  
WpL is about training in the workplace.  
However, training is but one small aspect  
of WpL: there can be a great deal of  
WpL taking place with no trainer or  
training in sight.</p>  
  
<p>Human resource (HR) development  
perspectives on WpL tend to focus on  
outcomes for the individual, their career  
development, and outcomes for the  
organisation. Matthews, for example,  
captures this in the following definition: </p>  
  
<p>[WpL] involves the process  
of reasoned learning towards  
desirable outcomes for the  
individual and the organisation.  
These outcomes should foster the  
sustained development of both the  
individual and the organisation,  
within the present and future  
context of organisational goals and  
individual career development.<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>This definition seems entirely reasonable,  
but it has its limitations. Outcomes  
to what end is a question that needs  
asking. “Desirable” for who, and for  
what? Matthews’ definition suggests  
that employees are puppets, to be  
moulded and manipulated according  
to the ethics and value propositions of  
the organisation. </p>  
  
<p>A more holistic approach is taken by  
Billett, who notes that “as we think and  
act, we learn”; learning is inevitable, as  
we work.<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup> Sandberg also positions WpL  
holistically, emphasising the need for the  
development of collective competence in  
the workplace, suggesting that “without  
a shared understanding of their work,  
no cooperative interaction will emerge,  
and by then, no collective competence  
will appear in the work performance”.<sup><a href="#notes">3</a></sup>  
Collective competence, he postulates,  
is cultural; members are enculturated  
into the work and workplace. Sandberg  
uses the term “competence”, not as  
in competency-based training where  
skills and knowledge are broken into  
small tasks and separated, but as holistic  
performance within the relevant context.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
Training is but one small aspect of WpL: there can be a great deal of WpL taking place with no trainer or training in sight.  
</p>  
  
</div>  
  
<p>Another way to understand WpL is to  
break it down into the three key words:  
work, place and learning. This helps  
make explicit some of the assumptions  
inherent in a holistic understanding  
of WpL.</p>  
  
<p><strong>Work</strong>: the activities of the work being  
done. This could refer to where in the  
production or service chain an individual,  
team or division’s work falls, the purpose  
of the work, the design of the work,  
and the relations between different  
activities of the work. Understanding  
the nature of the ‘work’ is important,  
as how particular kinds of work are  
valued and rewarded impact the need  
and motivation of individuals, teams  
and divisions to learn. If an individual  
has little discretionary power and the  
job is quickly learnt, there is no need  
to keep learning.</p>  
  
<p><strong>Place</strong>: the sites or spaces of work.  
Notions of space evoke not only physical  
space and arrangements, but also  
cultural norms, the tools and knowledge  
workers use and have access to (or not),  
and the problems they need to identify,  
frame and solve. Physical arrangements  
can encourage or discourage dialogue  
and sharing, an important basis of WpL.  
Cultural norms such as the extent to  
which a workplace is supportive and  
accepting, for example of risk-taking or  
trial and error (or not), set up or deny  
affordances for learning.</p>  
  
<p><strong>Learning</strong>: definitions of WpL that are  
outcomes-based often regard learning  
as achieving desired behaviours. When  
learning is considered as training, there  
is usually a focus on individual cognition,  
with the assumption being that learning  
takes place inside an individual’s brain.  
This ignores the reality that learning  
is embodied: we sense, we feel, we  
respond emotionally. It also ignores  
that learning requires relations with  
people and objects in context. Learning  
is a highly social activity. When WpL is  
considered as training, both cognitive  
and behaviourist ideas of learning  
predominate.<sup><a href="#notes">4</a></sup> These approaches do  
little to help individuals and teams to  
apply their learning, or what Evans, Guile  
and Harris call putting knowledge to  
work.<sup><a href="#notes">5</a></sup> Developing understanding and  
making meaning begins with the active  
use of the relevant language. Social  
relations and exchange are necessary  
for individuals and teams to reconstruct  
their thinking through a process of higher  
levels of cognition, through doing the  
work. The extent to which this is possible  
is deeply influenced by the nature of the  
‘place’ of the workplace, as discussed  
above. We also need to keep in mind that  
expertise is not stable: it is an “ongoing  
collaborative and discursive [dialogic]  
construction of tasks, solutions, visions,  
breakdowns and innovations”.<sup><a href="#notes">6</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>‘Work’, ‘place’ and ‘learning’, and how  
each is understood, come together to  
create or limit possibilities for WpL.  
We can support learning by broadening  
understandings of learning beyond  
cognition, memorising and behavioural  
outcomes. WpL is about the relations  
between people, artefacts (e.g.,  
tools used), the language used, the  
environment, being valued, or not, and  
much more. Ways of thinking about  
WpL will determine how WpL is used  
and enacted in workplace(s).</p>  
  
<p>This brings us to considering the framing  
of issues to which WpL may be a, or a  
partial, solution. Rarely is WpL a total  
solution; for example, job redesign,  
hierarchical structures, reward systems  
and so on may also need attention.</p>

<h3 class="title">How David Reframed a WpL Issue</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>In a workplace involving heavy machinery, there are workers from many nationalities  
and cultures, where Singaporeans work closely with other migrant workers from  
the neighbouring countries: India, mainland China and Malaysia. The local on-site  
supervisors would often be frustrated with foreign team members for not wearing  
steel-capped boots, helmets and other personal protective equipment, and with  
those who speed across workspaces when operating forklifts.</p>  
<p>To address these concerns, David, a member of the human resource team, focused  
on addressing the performance gaps in the competencies foreign equipment  
operators appeared to be lacking in. However, with the help of some reading  
and peers, David realised that the deficit approach of assuming that the foreign  
operators lacked skills had to be challenged. He commented in an assignment<sup>1</sup>  
that:</p>  
<p>I was…influenced by preconceived stereotypical ideas of the foreign  
operators’ work practice. These had blindsided me from their strengths  
and competence, which were equally important, as these are personal  
factors that would also influence and shape their learning interventions.  
I realised that the stereotypical perception that they were novices had  
to be challenged, as their behaviours were not due to their lack of skills,  
but due to the culture and the work environment they had back home.  
This subsequently led me to reframe my perspective and improve the  
roadmap [the learning intervention to establish a culture of safe practices]  
by looking at strategies that capitalise on the strengths of the learners  
and supervisors who are their mentors.<sup>2</sup></p>  
<p>Even though the operators might have years of experience in their home country,  
David realised that there was a lack of understanding of each nationality’s working  
culture, and a lack of trust in the competence of the group of foreign operators  
by the local supervisors and operators. He noted that it did not help that there  
were limited face-to-face interactions between the different groups, and limited  
time for coaching and reflection sessions with mentors and supervisors.</p>

<h3>WPL FOR WHAT PURPOSE?</h3>  
  
<p>The resolution of problems lies not  
within an individual, but is embedded  
in ways of thinking, artefacts, relations,  
power dynamics and so on. Outcomes-based HR approaches may use frames  
of thinking such as the one David (see  
box story) initially began with, in which  
he regarded the foreign workers as  
being deficient, having gaps in their  
knowledge and skills. However, if training  
the workers in wearing personal protective  
equipment (PPE) and to drive safely  
was seen to be the solution, then the  
underlying problems of understanding  
the cultural, institutional requirements  
of safe working practices, and the lack  
of trust and communication between  
the different groups of workers would  
not only remain unaddressed, but keep  
surfacing in various ways, over time.</p>  
  
<p>So, what changed David’s perspective?  
Instead of considering the individual  
workers as having gaps in knowledge  
and skills and their behaviours needing  
to be changed to achieve safe workplace  
practices as an outcome, he looked at  
the issue from different angles, seeking  
to understand the connectedness, the  
relations between them. He considered  
the individual, the culture of the  
workplace, the systems, and objects  
in the workplace, and came to see, for  
example, that the culture and systems  
in place were not supportive of safe  
working practices.</p>  
  
<p>In this example, I focused on the cultural  
issues which were present at two levels:  
1) the workplace norms, the lack of  
trust between supervisors and foreign  
workers, and between Singaporeans  
and foreign workers, and 2) national  
cultural understandings of safe working  
practices. Institutional practices differ  
across countries. Workers who come  
from a country where it is accepted on  
many sites to wear flipflop sandals when  
working with heavy machinery may  
give less thought to wearing PPE, for  
instance. David’s eventual solution was  
to set up sessions with different groups  
coming together to share stories of their  
working cultures. This enculturated trust  
and support between the groups, and  
at the same time enculturated workers  
into different practices appropriate to  
their worksite. In an environment where  
there is trust, questions and feedback  
become a norm (keeping in mind that  
norms constantly change as incidents  
and people change).</p>  
  
<p>Present in David’s story is an understanding  
of WpL shifting from an outcomes-based  
behaviourist, cognitive approach to  
learning, to a holistic enactment of WpL.  
Specifically, David considered relations  
between many aspects: individuals,  
the unit/department, cultural norms  
in the workplace, institutional and  
national understandings of safe working  
practices. To develop safe working  
practices, David implicitly understood  
that “cognitive action” involves using  
and interacting with artefacts (e.g., PPE,  
yellow lines marking out different uses  
of space, etc.), as well as of language  
and its situational meanings.<sup><a href="#notes">7</a></sup> David  
was using a relational understanding  
of WpL, putting together the different  
aspects of work, place and learning.  
David’s practice changed from seeing  
a problem as a set of gaps in learner’s  
competence (and organising training  
to address these), to digging deeper  
to understand what was going on. He  
asked questions of different groups of  
workers, to make decisions based on  
data. In using the data, he was able to  
deliberately put behind him the usual  
stereotypes and ways of thinking, and  
come up with different understandings of  
the problem and novel learning solutions.</p>  
  
<p>How a problem is framed, how it is  
named, determines the shape of the  
solution(s). Getting this right is critical  
in designing WpL.</p>  
  
<h3>IS YOUR WORKPLACE SUPPORTING POSSIBILITIES FOR WPL?</h3>  
  
<p>Possibilities for WpL are embedded  
in the work, although the learning  
may turn out to be negative (e.g., I  
am not trusted, so why bother) or  
positive (e.g., leading to wanting to  
contribute more).</p>  
  
<p>The importance of support, openness,  
trust and strong communication channels  
are nothing new to readers: they are  
basic foundations for WpL. Often  
classified as being part of culture, they  
are more than engineered conditions  
and a set of attitudes embodied  
by workers.<sup><a href="#notes">8</a></sup> Cultures are dynamic,  
they constitute an organisation's  
structures, day-to-day practices of  
sayings, doings and ways of relating.<sup><a href="#notes">9</a>&nbsp;</sup>Therefore, it is necessary to constantly work at adjusting structures, means of recognition, opportunities for workers  
to share and work together, and much more.</p>

was demoralised.</p>

<h3 class="title">How Su Chin Developed a Supportive WpL Culture</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Su Chin, a new team head within a service organisation, quickly realised her team  
was demoralised. There was high attrition, practices were inconsistent, workloads  
were uneven, and other teams in the organisation that her team serviced were  
frustrated at not getting what they needed.</p>  
<p>Determined to address these issues, Su Chin began with gathering data: she  
designed a set of questions, talked with team members and other teams, and  
found out what support was available within the organisation.</p>  
<p>On analysing this data, she was pleasantly surprised to realise that her team  
members had developed resilience through self-learning to address the constant  
changes the team experienced as a part of their work. Despite high attrition  
rates, she discovered two experts within the team with domain and know-how  
knowledge on procedures, processes and networks. New members were very  
willing to help, with some offering to participate in new projects, and finally, she  
found that feedback and knowledge exchange with the team’s organisational  
stakeholders was strong.</p>  
<p>Against this positive context were a number of constraints: the team experts felt  
unrecognised and undervalued; team members were protective of their domain  
knowledge, contributing to limited trust and issues with coverage during absences;  
internal stakeholders complained their requests were not handled on time and  
the quality of the work was poor; there were no regular feedback channels in  
place and no guides on how to undertake standard tasks.</p>  
<p>Armed with this knowledge, Su Chin began gaining her team’s trust by finding  
out, one-on-one, each team member’s learning needs and reasons for their low  
morale. Using this knowledge, she organised training on common learning needs.</p>  
<p>But first, she shared (generically) her findings from her one-on-one sessions  
with the message, “I hear you and these are the next steps”. She introduced a  
buddy system to ensure coverage and support for each member, clearly laying  
out responsibilities, such as reviewing each other’s work and covering each  
other’s absences. She officially appointed the two experts as mentors to guide  
and support newer team members, giving them recognition and showing she  
valued their contributions.</p>  
<p>Su Chin then established a number of project teams to develop frameworks for  
the writing of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and process guides, and  
to actually write these. This process started off in small achievable steps with a  
pilot, with team members providing feedback and support, prior to widening this  
work. Su Chin also established a structured Community of Practice,<sup>1</sup>, <sup>2</sup> as a space  
to provide feedback and support and identify improvement. All of this work was  
based on modelling and expecting open, honest, constructive feedback among  
team members</p>

<p>Su Chin (see box story) paid attention  
to this need, by providing not just  
a trustworthy ear but also tangible  
strategies to address her team’s low  
morale and poor quality of work.  
Importantly, she did not assume  
she knew what the issues were; like  
David, she sought to find out, from  
the ground. She <em>talked with</em> people,  
holding an open mind and open heart.  
Rather than judging team members  
as inept, she began from a position  
that they had strengths and sought  
to uncover and grow these strengths.  
She used a combination of approaches:  
ongoing dialogue; clearly conveying  
her strategy and plans; listening to  
suggestions for improving on her ideas;  
bringing in external trainers; recognising  
expertise; giving those who sought it,  
responsibility; and gradually building  
this trait in other team members.  
She also opened up communication  
channels, constantly building on the  
dynamic possibilities, nurturing a  
sense of pride and accomplishment.</p>  
  
<p>The focus should always be on the  
relations between people, things and  
structures. Learning can be highly  
effective when learning through doing  
the work. The point is that it is necessary  
to provide opportunities for dialogue,  
to learn the language with which to  
improve thinking about the work, and  
opportunities to put ideas to work. All  
of which needs to be underpinned by  
a belief in your people.</p>

<h3>REALISTIC AND MEANINGFUL  
EVALUATION OF WPL</h3>  
  
<p>Evaluating WpL is not about assessing  
the knowledge and skills of individuals  
and teams. Rather, like any project  
such as David’s and Su Chin’s, the  
evaluation of WpL is anchored on how  
the problem is named and framed, the  
objectives set, and the processes and  
tools used. WpL is relational, complex  
and dynamic; using a simple metrics  
approach cannot capture the nature  
of WpL or its multi-faceted outcomes.  
The evaluation of WpL must appraise  
the impact of activity.</p>  
  
<p>Project approaches to WpL can be a  
useful approach to evaluating WpL.  
Table 1 provides a simple, specific  
example of what this might look like,  
using Su Chin’s example.<br>  
<br>

<p>Table 1 provides a range of types of  
evidence. Much of it is qualitative, but  
nevertheless tangible. Implicit in this  
evidence is the development of a team  
identity that members are proud to  
belong to. Also inherent in this approach  
is that decision-making for identifying,  
framing and solutioning of problems is  
delegated to those doing the work. The  
relationship between job-design and  
WpL is important to keep in mind. In  
work settings, learning is richest when  
workers are identifying, framing, and  
meeting challenges.</p>

<h3>SOME FINAL THOUGHTS</h3>  
  
<p>WpL is not about teaching, nor is it about  
just one way of doing and thinking about  
a task. There is considerable research  
to show that the natural sensemaking  
ability of humans means that workers  
come up with a myriad of ways to achieve  
needed outcomes (be it consistent,  
high-speed accuracy or highly complex  
solutions). This appears to be, in part,  
a means to minimise mental and/or  
physical effort, leaving more energy  
for other contributions.<sup><a href="#notes">10</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>As a study of learning and innovation  
in Singapore small and medium-sized  
enterprises (SMEs) indicates, WpL is  
part of the identity of an organisation,  
of the way it is, and constantly evolves:</p>  
  
<p>Work complexity and variety are  
shaped not only by roles and  
expectations, but also by the  
perceptions of staff and their  
managers. Crucially, how managers  
and leaders perceive their staff  
and their work significantly  
influences an individual’s self-perception and inclination towards  
learning and innovation. As such,  
an organisation’s leadership is  
closely related to the learning  
opportunities provided for the  
worker.<sup><a href="#notes">11</a></sup></p>
