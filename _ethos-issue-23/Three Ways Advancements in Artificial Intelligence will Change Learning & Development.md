<h3>Background: AI Is Changing Every Aspect in Public Service</h3>  
  
<p>Singapore’s Digital Government Blueprint,<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup> recently revised in 2020, has set out a strategic plan to use data, connectivity, and computing to improve how every agency operates, delivers services, and engages stakeholders. Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a big role in this plan, holding the promise of making public services seamless and integrated for our citizens.</p>  
  
<p>AI also has the potential to transform  
Learning and Development (L&amp;D), the  
field for which the Civil Service College  
(CSC) is the lead public sector agency,  
by offering new affordances brought  
about through advances in AI, Machine  
Learning and Deep Learning. Singapore’s  
general- and higher-education sectors  
have outlined plans to personalise  
learning as part of the national push  
to use AI in the National AI Strategy,  
launched in 2019.<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup> While the education  
sector is on track to meet their goals,  
L&amp;D functions in government—and adult  
learning in general—could benefit from  
AI-related concepts such as adaptive  
learning. With the COVID-19 pandemic  
accelerating the pivot to digital means  
for work and learning, it is timely to  
reimagine how learning could be in the  
Public Service.</p>  
  
<p>We believe AI-driven shifts in learning  
can happen in three ways, following  
three commonly known conceptual  
models of AI in education: from <em>Creating  
to Curating</em> in the <strong>Domain</strong> model, from  
<em>Seeing to Knowing</em> in the <strong>Learner</strong> model,  
and from <em>Prescribing to Recommending</em>  
in the <strong>Pedagogical </strong>model.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
While there is great potential in using AI to codify well-defined knowledge, it is best used for less complex skills.  
</p>  
  
</div>  
  
<h3>From Creating to Curating—AI and the Domain Model</h3>  
  
<p>AI can be used to describe particular fields  
of knowledge in the form of a domain  
model, which typically consists of a web  
of ‘knowledge points’ that are related to  
each other in some way. Domain models  
might use mathematical concepts like  
combinatorics and stochastic processes to  
define and track these ‘knowledge points’,  
which are the smallest possible conceptual  
blocks of values, skills or knowledge.  
Traditionally, these are defined by  
experts and skilled domain professionals, but a  
recent 2020 Institute for Adult Learning  
report suggests that machine learning  
techniques can collate the appropriate  
materials and refine the relationships  
between knowledge points, based on  
how cohorts of learners perform on  
assessments.<sup><a href="#notes">3 </a></sup>This means L&amp;D experts  
in future could define the curriculum  
for a field in the form of knowledge  
points, and let AI determine the strength  
of relationships between each of its  
concepts. They can also let AI pick out  
the materials from a library of resources  
that will articulate each concept. The  
new role for human experts could then  
be to monitor the domain model and  
curate new concepts to be added.</p>  
  
<p>In L&amp;D, the work of establishing the  
structure of a curriculum usually entails  
selecting an appropriate curriculum  
model, determining appropriate  
standards for pre- or post-requisites,  
and developing the content. Most  
currently available adaptive learning  
management systems do a good job  
at teaching learners to acquire well-defined theoretical knowledge and  
concepts, but are less effective with  
practical curriculum tasks, such as  
honing the ability to reason logically  
or master a skill. So, while there is  
great potential in using AI to codify  
well-defined knowledge, it is best  
used for less complex skills on the  
lower end of Bloom’s taxonomy (a  
ranking of task complexity, commonly  
used in education). A good example  
of an AI-calibrated domain model  
might be a job role in procurement  
contract management, where in-class  
MCQ quizzes can accurately measure  
a learner’s competence in identifying  
supplier risk management strategies.</p>  
  
<p>How might AI refine a domain  
model? The model must first  
contain a set of matrices  
that map varying difficulty  
of assessment items to  
behavioural indicators.  
These matrices, called  
Q-matrices, can then  
be easily refined by  
using a combination of  
refinement methods. In  
curriculum areas where  
reasoning is important,  
especially causality, recent  
developments in AI show some  
promise in using qualitative  
reasoning techniques to refine  
domain models where usually ill-defined logical reasoning skills are  
important. Put simply, AI techniques can  
help curriculum designers intimately  
understand the relationships between  
skills in a competency map, thereby  
helping them evaluate and review  
the curriculum better.</p>  
  
<p>Of late, the lowest-hanging fruit  
seems to be in using AI to populate  
a map with content and resources.  
Advances in natural language  
understanding have given rise to a  
number of employee engagement  
platforms such as Microsoft Viva  
Topics (see box story on <em>Through the  
Looking-Glass</em>), which have enabled  
organisations to fuse a repository  
full of documents into a map of word  
topics, without the need for any human  
analyst. This helps people look for  
pieces of information and understand  
how they are related. Given a schema  
of competency frameworks, such  
systems will be able to automate  
the tagging of not just articles and  
learning objects but also existing  
organisational knowledge to the  
competency framework.</p>

<h3 class="title">Through the Looking-Glass: How A Public Officer Might Use the LEARN app in 2025</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Alice’s boss asks her to relook at and streamline the current procurement processes in her  
agency. On a Saturday afternoon, she happens to read an article in <em>The New York Times</em>  
on how robotic process automation (RPA) is making finance operations more efficient.</p>  
<p>As she reads and highlights key parts of the article, the LEARN app plug-in in her browser  
prompts her: “This can already be done in your agency. Click to find out how to get started  
or read these other related articles.”</p>  
<p>She proceeds to save these articles in her reading list in the LEARN app, where she can  
choose to make it ‘visible to others’ or ‘private’. Behind the interface, the app curates a  
short selection of:</p>  
<p>1. Short Coursera content on getting started with RPA (seeing that it is a new area for her,  
but she does know what it does and has some prior knowledge about it).</p>  
<p>2. Other <em>Harvard Business Review</em> articles on the web and on the LEARN app that other  
public officers have read on this topic (seeing that she is reading an article assessed  
to be of advanced difficulty).</p>  
<p>3. Short reflections/questions posted on Workplace that highlight the realities and difficulties  
of working with RPA bots (posts made by officers of similar seniority are selected).</p>  
<p>4. Using the Microsoft Viva Topics service hosted on the Government Commercial Cloud  
(GCC), a list of recent documents on her department’s Microsoft SharePoint that are  
related to RPA (prioritising those in the finance domain)</p>  
<p>5. A mood meter on the current sentiments on RPA derived from Twitter and other Social  
Media of the day (seeing that the topic has reached substantial media saturation).</p>  
<p>6. Other officers across the Public Service who have worked on a project that made use  
of RPA (prioritising those in the finance domain).</p>  
<p>Alice gets excited and makes a post on SG-Teams to her teammates on  
Outlook, starting with: “Hey guys, I think I know how to reduce the procurement  
process by using RPA to scrape GeBIZ…” The LEARN app plug-in on M365  
suggests quotes from articles she has read that she could append to her email.</p>  
<p>Another team in Agency X then uses Miro to generate a timeline for a similar project  
and starts writing a task to ‘explore the use of RPA’ which is tagged as a to-do item.  
The LEARN app plug-in in Miro starts prompting the team with a note: “Alice from  
Agency Y has recently implemented an RPA project in a similar situation. Would you  
like to connect with her?”</p>  
<p>An L&amp;D specialist in CSC is alerted that many officers of a certain Ministry family are  
regularly researching and trying out RPA techniques. He writes an email to a group  
of officers, inviting them to informally share how they are using these tools in their  
work with other identified officers who are currently exploring its use. When the  
group comes together, the L&amp;D specialist facilitates the conversation, knowing the  
materials the participants have read and drawing on their past experiences to make  
the discussion rich and highly relatable.</p>

<h3>From Seeing to  
Knowing—AI and  
the Learner Model</h3>  
  
<p>AI has proven able in carrying out  
specific ‘sensing’ tasks, like identifying  
a person’s facial expression, tone in  
text messages, pose, and even speech.  
However, these perceived emotions  
may not be entirely true. There is  
no convincing evidence that facial  
expressions reveal a person’s feelings,  
and in fact, a <em>Nature </em>article in 2020  
argues that there is “little to no  
evidence that people can reliably  
infer someone else’s emotional state  
from a set of facial movements”.<sup><a href="#notes">4</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>Nevertheless, instructors and trainers  
can use these and a range of other  
signals to better understand learners’  
reactions or feelings accurately in a  
lesson. What is so unique about this  
human ability that enables instructors  
and trainers to ‘read’ their learners?  
Is there a more objective way to do  
this than just gut sense?</p>  
  
<p>Will we get to a point where technology  
can know the learner well, cognitively  
and socio-emotionally? Currently, the answer is no. But when augmented  
with a skilled trainer, computer vision  
technology is surprisingly good at  
assessing and identifying performance  
issues in training simulations and  
situational tests. For instance, in  
MINDEF’s Murai Urban Training Facility,<sup><a href="#notes">5</a></sup>  
training areas are extensively outfitted with  
cameras and sensors to collect implicit  
learner-produced data, enabling high-fidelity after-action review sessions to  
accurately identify soldiers’ performance  
gaps, and refine team strategy and  
tradecraft. In bus driver training, the  
Land Transport Authority has employed  
the use of Advanced Driver Assistance  
Systems to detect fatigue and attention  
of drivers by tracking eye movements and other telematics of their driving  
performance.<sup><a href="#notes">6</a></sup> This data is used to  
incentivise good driver habits and for  
training purposes.</p>  
  
<p>At present, the use cases of AI in L&amp;D  
stop at diagnosis: AI neither predicts  
how trainers, instructors, or learners  
will act, nor prescribes how they  
should modify their actions. This  
might be about to change. Further  
into the future, DL techniques  
used in gait and pose estimation,  
for example, could enhance the  
accuracy of sensor systems. Along  
with an expert-informed tagging  
of already-collected multimodal  
data in more aspects other than  
those mentioned, we could see a day  
when learner models can accurately  
predict when learners need an expert’s  
assistance, even before they know it, and  
even inform them with a high degree  
of certainty there is some likely error  
that they will make. In other words,  
tools used by instructors, trainers, or  
learners could become highly certain  
of a learner’s knowledge state.</p>  
  
<hr>  
  
<h5><em>  
An AI-enabled system can intervene in a timely, contextual manner relevant to each learner.  
</em></h5>  
  
<hr>  
  
<h3>From Prescribing to Recommending—AI and the Pedagogical Model</h3>  
  
<p>AI is unlikely to ever fully replace the  
instructor, trainer, or coach. With the  
ever-expanding collection of data  
in the domain model (containing  
values, skills, knowledge, and how  
they relate to each other) and the  
learner model (containing cognitive  
and socio-emotional states), an AI-enabled system can intervene in a  
timely, contextual manner relevant  
to each learner. While this would  
be difficult for a trainer or coach to  
perform for every learner all the time,  
they are still needed to perform tasks  
that humans are better at. They can  
read the affective cues of each learner  
and tailor the experience to their  
needs with empathy. For example, a  
PSD career coach could use personal  
interest, prior work experience and  
knowledge data in the LEARN app  
to provide tailored advice and ask  
more pointed questions to help the  
officer come to their own conclusions  
about their skillsets and options,  
coherently weaving these, along with  
appropriate encouragement and tact,  
into a meaningful career trajectory  
and narrative.</p>  
  
<p>One of the most promising areas in AI in  
L&amp;D is the personalisation of individual  
learning paths using a highly informed  
and adaptive learning management  
system. Adaptivity can be thought of  
in two ways: first, macro-adaptivity,  
where learners are presented with  
what activities, knowledge or even  
groups of peers they are predicted  
to be able to learn or learn with; and  
second, micro-adaptivity, where  
adaptive systems can intervene when  
necessary—if learners show signs that  
they might not be able to perform  
a required competency or skill—by  
providing short guidance on how to  
proceed. With a constant check on  
their prior knowledge and confidence  
in using the knowledge, adaptive  
systems could keep learners on the  
most efficient path to full mastery of  
content matter.</p>  
  
<p>This idea has in fact been used  
successfully in general and higher  
education around the world,<sup><a href="#notes">7</a></sup> but  
it often takes the form of adaptive  
testing rather than adaptive learning  
systems. Micro-adaptive systems are  
also known as Intelligent Tutoring  
Systems in the L&amp;D literature.<sup><a href="#notes">8</a></sup> They  
are becoming more widespread as  
domain models in some content  
areas become much better codified  
(for example, in many primary and  
secondar y school mathematics  
syllabuses, content and assessments  
have been made adaptive).</p>  
  
<p>Further in the future, learning  
companions or assistants could provide  
accurate answers and direct a learner  
to relevant resources, in their moment  
of learning need. Such companions  
could offer work-relevant links to  
bridge theory and practice, be  
personable, and create conversations  
where a trainer or expert cannot. An  
early example of such companions  
is Clippit, the paperclip-shaped  
office assistant that first appeared  
in Microsoft Office 97 to help users  
use Office features more effectively.  
Since then, chatbots like the one seen  
in Google’s LaMDA (see box story on  
<em>What We Mean by AI</em>) have become  
much more capable.</p>

<h3 class="title">What We Mean by AI</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p><strong>What is AI?</strong></p>  
<p>AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a general term for computer programmes  
that can sense, reason, adapt and act. Such programmes, and their use in  
real-world applications, have advanced rapidly in recent years.<sup>1</sup></p>  
<p><strong>What made it popular in the recent decade?</strong></p>  
<p>AI has been researched since the 1950s as a science of building intelligent programmes  
to solve problems (think autopilot on planes). Work on Machine Learning (ML) began in  
the 1980s, when statistical ‘learning’ algorithms started improving machine performance  
without being explicitly programmed (think recommended titles in Netflix). To the  
layperson, AI remained largely a sci-fi topic until the 2010s, when faster and cheaper  
computing power and an exponential increase in data availability made Deep Learning  
(DL) possible. Inspired by workings of the human brain, DL uses algorithms to identify  
and classify patterns in large amounts of data. From such analysis, programmes can  
then draw conclusions or take relevant actions (such as in self-driving cars).</p>  
<p><strong>What AI can’t (and shouldn’t) do…for now</strong></p>  
<p>Prominent researcher Yoshua Bengio has said that AI still needs to be extended “to do  
things like reasoning, learning causality, and exploring the world in order to learn and  
acquire information”.<sup>2</sup> Largely founded on mathematical concepts like linear regression,  
statistics and game theory, AI is likely very good at doing specific repetitive tasks such  
as moving goods in a warehouse, as well as augmenting humans in more complex tasks  
such as detecting and treating cancer. However, it lacks empathy and other affective  
aspects of being human. Hence, the FATE aspects (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency,  
Ethics) should be addressed when planning and implementing AI, whatever the use case.</p>  
<hr>  
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>  
<ol>  
<li style="text-align: left;">To better grasp the power and speed at which AI has developed, watch this recent  
    May 2021 conversation about a learning interaction between a child and a Google  
    dialogue model called LaMDA. Notice how human-like the programme is in the way it  
    handles open-ended dialogue content. <br>

<h3>Epilogue: Some Realities</h3>  
  
<p>Much of the vision outlined above  
relies heavily on large swathes of data,  
which takes time to amass and prepare  
for use by ML/DL algorithms. There  
is also an assumption that systems  
are developed in line with adequate  
risk assessment such that they can  
address the ethical, FATE aspects of AI,  
although most risks can be mitigated  
by following the guidelines in the  
Model AI Governance Framework set  
out by IMDA governing AI-augmented  
decision-making.<sup><a href="#notes">9</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>CSC has started work on integrating  
and cleaning existing data so that it  
can be ready to build a recommender  
engine. While the first iteration may be  
just a simple non-personalised filter of  
sorts for course recommendation, to  
be deployed on CSC’s public-officerfacing learning programme portal, future  
iterations may use user-item interaction  
data to build a range of functionalities.  
These include Content-based filtering  
as data becomes cleaner and more  
standardised, Model/Memory-based  
Collaborative filtering as more users  
use the recommendations, or Deep  
Learning-based models that make the recommendations personalised as  
more types of data about the public  
officer becomes available. With a robust  
recommendation algorithm, informed  
by other data models (viz. learner and  
domain models) being built in the future,  
a truly personalised experience can be  
delivered to every public officer.</p>  
  
<p>With time, we will get there, either  
sooner (with responsible and trusted  
access to user data and efficient AI  
techniques like transfer learning could  
shorten the time-to-market), or later  
(e.g., if the user privacy movement  
pushback is significant or learner data  
requires great effort to clean up for  
use). Even though there is generally high  
trust in government services, recently  
reported surveys have concluded, for  
instance, that senior citizens remain  
less receptive to having AI interpret  
medical results.<sup><a href="#notes">10</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>It is a leap to say that public officers  
will react similarly to learning with and  
from an AI-enabled tool, but for now,  
the challenge remains to overcome  
these adjustment hurdles. In order to  
use such smart systems effectively,  
change management and professional  
development for L&amp;D practitioners,  
learners and other stakeholders, will  
need to be worked through.</p>
