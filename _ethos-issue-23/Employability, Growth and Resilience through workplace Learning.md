<h3>A Key Paradigm Shift</h3>  
  
<p>The term Workplace Learning has  
become a buzzword in recent times,  
but it is actually part of a fundamental  
paradigm shift for the nation that  
has been carefully considered and  
planned. In 2013, the Ministry of  
Manpower established the Singapore  
Workforce Development Agency  
(WDA) to address the employment  
challenges of mismatched skills vis-à-vis job opportunities in Singapore.</p>  
  
<p>WDA invested in training programmes  
to support workforce employability  
and build professional expertise in  
curriculum development for adult  
learning and skills certification.</p>  
  
<p>In 2017, the Committee on the Future  
Economy highlighted that our workers  
need to continuously deepen and refresh  
skills,<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup>  
given the growing prevalence  
of automation and transformation.  
Instead of relying solely on knowledge  
gained through the formal education  
system, the Committee recognised  
that each individual would have to  
reinvent themselves and learn anew  
throughout their lives. This was a  
powerful mindset shift: it also meant  
that employers would need to actively  
invest in and help their employees gain  
relevant skills on an ongoing basis, with  
the workplace becoming a legitimate  
classroom where one learns.</p>  
  
<p>As part of this national thrust towards  
lifelong learning, the Ministry of Trade  
and Industry led the rollout of what  
are called Industry Transformation  
Maps (ITMs) for 23 industries—charting  
the long-term vision and direction in  
the years ahead for these sectors.  
SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG)—a  
statutory board under the Ministry of  
Education that drives and coordinates  
the implementation of the national  
SkillsFuture movement—complemented  
this with the <em>Skills Framework</em>,  
for which various lead agencies,  
employers, industry associations and  
unions furnish information on sector,  
career pathways, job roles, skills and  
training programmes. These two  
elements have become roadmaps  
for organisations and employees  
to chart a course in cultivating the  
most relevant competencies for their  
upgrading and mastery.</p>

<h3 class="title">Putting Workplace Learning (WpL) into Industrial Practice</h3>  
<p class="text"><img title="Workplace Learning\_photo 1" style="vertical-align: middle;" src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_23/Workplace_Learning_Photo1.jpg" alt="Workplace Learning\_photo 1"></p>  
<p style="text-align: justify;color:white;" class="small-text">NACE, led by NYP, draws on the expertise of international institutions to adapt Best-In-Class (BIC) models for organisations in Singapore. NACE was officially launched by Minister Ong Ye Kung, together with SSG, Swiss and German Ambassadors, on 30 July 2018.</p>  
<p>In 2018, the National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning (NACE) was  
formed to help companies understand the ITM roadmaps and install purposeful  
WpL systems. Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP), with its long history of working with  
industry, was appointed to set up the Centre. Supported by SSG, NYP drew on its  
networks with acknowledged world leaders in WpL, the Germans and the Swiss,<sup>1</sup>  
to find a system and contextualise it for Singapore’s needs.</p>  
<p>Today, there is a network of NACEs in different educational institutions such as  
the Singapore Institute of Technology, the Institute for Adult Learning, Ngee  
Ann Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic, and Temasek  
Polytechnic to efficiently propagate the WpL message throughout Singapore.  
More than 1,000 organisations have benefitted from the efforts of NACE and  
NACE Centres to date</p>

<h3>Workplace Learning (WpL) Defined</h3>  
  
<p>The International Labour Organization  
defines Workplace Learning as “the  
acquisition of knowledge or skills by  
formal or informal means that occurs in  
the workplace”. This is in contrast with  
knowledge or skills acquisition outside  
the workplace, such as in classrooms.  
WpL includes both formal on-the-job  
training and informal learning at work.<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>In essence: WpL is a structured and  
professional system to help employees  
gain—in the parlance—Knowledge, Skills  
and Attitudes (KSA) effectively, and to  
support employers in retaining knowledge  
within the organisation.</p>  
  
<p>All too often, in our experience working  
with organisations, we see firms struggle  
because employees are training in  
competencies that are irrelevant to current  
needs. Sometimes, even if the training  
is appropriate and for relevant skills, it  
can be a challenge to get employees to  
put it into practice at work. Furthermore,  
without the proper documentation of  
how the job is done, the loss of a key  
colleague can mean a loss of institutional  
knowledge and key skills. To restart  
the building of these skills can require  
significant time and resources—a cost  
most organisations can ill afford.</p>  
  
<p>WpL is both an administrative structure,  
where there are specific documents  
charting the expected competencies  
of each employee and their training  
development pathways, as well as a  
system of formal and informal training  
methods such as the following:</p>  
  
<p><strong>On-the-Job Training (OJT)</strong> is a form  
of learning in the work environment  
during the employment period. It is  
usually carried out in a structured  
manner with the support of subject  
matter experts (also known as  
coaches). OJT is probably the  
most common WpL practice in  
Singapore, but organisations often  
implement it in an ad hoc manner.  
In 2019, NACE harmonised the OJT  
Blueprint template with assessment  
rubrics used in Work-Study  
Programmes (WSPs) offered by  
local polytechnics and the Institute  
of Technical Education (ITE). The  
OJT Blueprint is a document that  
codifies the tacit knowledge and  
tasks for a job role, with required  
KSA and relevant guidelines for  
learning at the workplace. As a  
result, other polytechnics and ITE  
have since adopted NYP’s OJT  
Blueprint and assessment rubrics.</p>  
  
<p><strong>Apprenticeships </strong>are competency-based learning stints with companies,  
usually at the company's premises.  
Apprentices are employed full-time to acquire the competencies  
to perform at a higher level or  
with an expanded job scope. It is  
more prevalent in European Union  
countries, where WpL culture is  
deeply rooted in the workforce,  
and usually leads to formal or  
professional qualifications. In  
Singapore, we have WSPs offered  
by Institutes of Higher Learning  
using OJT blueprints as part of  
the structured WpL mechanism  
to promote a culture of learning.</p>  
  
<p><strong>Internships/Traineeships </strong>are short-term WpL arrangements where  
interns or trainees learn on the job, both formally and informally.</p>  
  
<p>Typically, each learner receives an allowance during their internship,  
and learning is structured at the workplace.</p>  
  
<div class="break">

<p style="text-align: center;" class="small-text">An MOU to harmonise OJT practices across  
Institutes of Higher Learning was signed on 12 July 2019 by representatives of the five polytechnics  
and ITE.</p>  
  
<h3>A Positive Sea Change</h3>  
  
<p>Hearteningly, data suggests that workers  
in Singapore have embraced the idea  
of lifelong learning.</p>  
  
<p>A <em>Straits Times</em> article in 2019 highlights  
how receiving sufficient training to  
perform their jobs effectively is a key  
factor towards enhanced job satisfaction,  
an increased desire to go to work, and  
higher staff retention rates for the  
Singapore workforce.<sup><a href="#notes">3</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>Several other key polls and reports also  
echo this. For example, according to a  
poll by hiring consultancy Randstad in  
2020, 86% of respondents in Singapore  
are motivated to upskill and reskill, to  
prepare for industrial changes resulting  
from automation and digitalisation.<sup><a href="#notes">4</a></sup>  
Another report by Ernst &amp; Young, based  
on a survey of over 4,000 employers  
and employees in June and July 2020,  
indicates that 84% of employees  
identify the adoption of digital tools  
as critical for the future of work.<sup><a href="#notes">5</a></sup> The  
same report shows that employees rank  
virtual learning, alongside health and  
safety in the workplace, as their top  
development focus.</p>  
  
<p>Staff want organisations to invest in  
their development and provide a safe  
and nurturing environment for them to  
succeed and thrive—especially at a time  
of uncertainty and rapid change.</p>  
  
<p>As job responsibilities enlarge and shift,  
the need to bridge the gap between  
learning new skills and applying knowledge  
at the workplace becomes more critical  
than before. WpL empowers workers  
because it allows employees to identify  
their weaknesses, gaps, inconsistencies,  
and dissatisfaction both within their  
current job scope and in relation to  
future demands.</p>  
  
<p>Staff who seek to grow with an organisation  
should expect well-structured and  
transparent WpL systems that allow  
contextualisation, flexibility, and authentic  
learning to enable optimal performance.</p>  
  
<p>I recently spoke to a Mr Tan, an employee  
whose company has worked with NACE  
to implement the WpL system referencing  
the National Workplace Learning  
Framework. It was a short conversation  
on the sidelines of a discussion—but you  
could see how he was encouraged by  
the fact that his organisation had chosen  
to invest in its workers. He knew that  
the work was meaningful and felt that it  
would make employees, like himself, feel  
confident of a caring and progressive  
organisation.</p>  
  
<p>Employers are certainly getting the  
memo about skills being the currency  
of the future: PricewaterhouseCoopers’  
24th Annual Global CEO Survey6 has  
found that while most leaders believe  
the need for new skills is their biggest  
challenge in a rapidly changing workplace  
environment, however, the crucial next  
step is for employers to take great  
ownership of WpL.</p>

<h3>The Role of Leaders in the Next Mile</h3>  
  
<p>In a 2020 symposium on shaping the  
future of education, then-Minister for  
Education Lawrence Wong called on  
employers to re-examine how they use  
workplaces for learning.</p>  
  
<p>He explained how, while many learn by  
doing—through the "process of trial and  
error", "feedback and tips from colleagues,  
or just by watching how other people  
do it"—such learning was often ad hoc.<sup><a href="#notes">7</a></sup>  
Mr Wong called for organisations to  
create a systematic, structured and  
deliberately well-thought-out process for  
their workers’ learning to be effective.<sup><a href="#notes">8</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>Indeed, some leaders have cottoned on  
to how the strategic effort to provide  
their employees with the time and space  
for WpL will go a long way in cementing  
their employees’ motivation, professional  
growth, and loyalty, and in readying their  
organisations for the future.</p>  
  
<p>Despite the successes of firms who have  
adopted WpL, many other business  
leaders remain concerned with the here-and-now. Some of their reservations  
stem from their beliefs about the time,  
commitment and resources needed for  
WpL, while balancing existing business  
operations. Some are concerned about  
a lack of coaches/mentors to support  
WpL implementation. Hence, they  
continue to expend their resources on  
coping with immediate uncertainties.  
But this approach does not bring long-term strength, stability, or growth.</p>  
  
<p>There are ways to ease the transition into  
WpL adoption. Funding and bespoke  
consultancy support are available  
to kick-start the WpL process. And  
firms can take incremental steps. A  
start is better than no start, and there  
are tangible benefits to be had. For  
organisations ready to deep dive into  
WpL, certification allows validation of  
processes and affirmation of successes.</p>  
  
<p>Amid volatility and uncertainty, the role  
of a leader in building an equitable and  
innovative workplace becomes more  
critical than ever. Leaders need to re-examine their leadership strategies  
and consider how they can create  
a continuous learning culture. This  
includes engaging with the ground,  
being inclusive, and kindling the  
dynamism that grows the confidence  
and capabilities of their people.</p>  
  
<p>Although the journey might seem  
daunting, the experience and outcome  
will be rewarding. NACE will also walk  
the journey with employers to help them  
gain strategic competitive advantage  
through WpL.</p>  
  
  
  <div class="containerbox">  
  
  
<h3 class="title">Nurturing Our Catalysts: A National Workplace Learning Framework</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>To the end of creating more catalysts for change, NACE has collaborated with strategic  
partners from the Trade Associations &amp; Chambers and unions such as Singapore National  
Employers Federation, Specialists Trade Alliance of Singapore, National Trades Union  
Congress (NTUC), and NTUC LearningHub to propagate the value and benefits of WpL to  
employers and employees. They are the critical enablers to contextualising and growing  
WpL in various domains.</p>  
<p>To further support local organisations of private and public sectors in implementing a robust  
WpL culture, NACE (led by NYP) developed a National Workplace Learning Framework,  
which has since been adopted by SSG in January 2020.<sup>1</sup></p>  
<p>The Framework marks a strategic movement to provide organisations with a holistic guide  
to transition to WpL. It is a step-by-step map that organisations can use to plan, execute,  
customise, and track their incremental milestones in WpL, and see that it is achievable. It  
also establishes a common language across sectors to build a WpL ecosystem.</p>  
<p>Organisations that want to embark on this transformation can use the six components of  
the Framework to benchmark their WpL readiness.</p>  
<p>We have empowered all NACE Centres to adopt this methodology and collectively help  
organisations implement WpL.</p>  
<p>Today, there is also a national-level certification that recognises organisations which have  
developed a sustainable learning culture.<sup>2</sup> This initiative aims to forge a community of  
WpL adopters for collective learning and enablers to create multiplier effects for shaping  
a WpL culture and mindset in Singapore.</p>  
<p style="text-align: left;">That said, the Framework and the certification are guides, developed to help organisations  
visualise the WpL journey. At the end of the day, these tools are meant to help bridge the  
distance between organisations and their employees.<br>

One of the critical advantages of WpL

<h3 class="title">Boosting Organisational Performance through WpL</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Novotel Singapore on Stevens and Gardenia have seen significant improvements  
in their operations, staff development and morale after adopting WpL efforts.  
Novotel Singapore on Stevens collaborated with NACE to develop clear career  
progression pathways and structured OJT blueprints for talents across all levels,  
through redesigning work processes to improve productivity. As a result, the  
organisation attracted and retained good talent and was awarded the SkillsFuture  
Employer Awards 2020. For Gardenia, staff training significantly reduced lead  
time by 30% through structured WpL processes.</p>  
<p>In the security sector, Metropolis Security Systems Pte Ltd, a local small and  
medium-sized enterprise (SME), increased their profits by achieving a 100%  
success rate in their bidding projects, compared to 11% previously. There was  
also a reduction in staff turnover rate from 40% to 12%.</p>  
<p>WpL has also helped Grand Venture Technology, a manufacturing solutions  
company that embarked on transformation through WpL in 2019, develop a  
sense of shared purpose that runs through the firm. The CEO, Mr Julian Ng, noted  
that one of the critical advantages of WpL is that it captures tacit knowledge  
within the organisation: valuable knowledge, skills and attitudes that might  
otherwise be lost.</p>  
  
  
  
</div>  
  
  
  
  
  
<h3>The WpL Journey Continues</h3>  
  
<p>The journey of WpL is organic and  
collaborative. Employers play a pivotal  
role in taking stock of skills predisposition,  
humanising workflow, and reimagining  
WpL as a process of continuous learning.  
When they find value in each person  
in their workforce, and re-design jobs  
to be better adapted to the vagaries  
of our modern world, they can unlock  
tacit knowledge and benefit from a  
motivated workforce who can excel and  
bring growth.</p>  
  
<p>In return, employees will also benefit  
from seeing what their learning maps to,  
understanding the context of changes  
and most importantly finding trust in  
organisations which are investing in  
their futures.</p>  
  
<p>It is a mutually reinforcing virtuous cycle,  
to which everyone contributes, for the  
gain of all.</p>
