<p>Technological advances and other societal  
trends often impact how employees work  
and learn, and the COVID-19 pandemic  
has both amplified and hastened these  
effects for the near- to medium-term  
future. In the field of learning and  
development (L&amp;D), insights drawn from  
the literature, as well as from leaders  
and practitioners in the Singapore  
Public Service, suggest that four such  
trends will have a significant impact  
on the culture and landscape of work,  
and in turn on L&amp;D practice, for some  
time to come. While these trends may  
not be new, the pandemic has changed  
their trajectory in ways that warrant  
consideration and action today.</p>  
  
<h3>Four Trends Impacting the Learning and Development Landscape</h3>  
  
<p>The first trend is that innovative and  
disruptive business models will be a  
common and pervasive part of the general  
economic landscape. Organisations are  
looking outside of themselves and even  
outside of their industry to support their  
business. By maintaining critical functions  
‘buy(ing)’ or ‘build(ing)’, they can then  
‘borrow’ or ‘bot’<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup>  
other capabilities so  
that their core remains lean, and the  
organisation stays agile. Examples of this  
trend include ridesharing/hailing apps  
like Grab/Uber: these platform-driven  
companies tap on gig workers as their  
main employee base. Another example is  
Airbnb: a networked, community-based  
organisation that helps its participating  
members organise its saleable resources.  
</p>  
  
<p>The pandemic has further accelerated  
this shift as organisations look to “[using]  
fresh strategic framing and [creating]  
organisational structures that promote  
agility”, and “collaborating with...start-ups and...expertise around the world”  
to survive and thrive in its aftermath.<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup>  
Identifying and developing the critical  
capabilities for a transformed organisation  
requires strategic capabilities, and we  
propose that L&amp;D teams need to support  
their executive management beyond the  
typical purview of L&amp;D work in the past.</p>  
  
<p>The second trend is that the nature  
of work is changing dramatically in a  
very short time. Technology is driving  
labour markets towards greater levels  
of informality, where gig workers often  
have fewer protections, and where there  
is increasing demand for non-routine  
cognitive and interpersonal skills.<sup><a href="#notes">3</a></sup> One  
source suggests that two-thirds of  
employees in high-performing firms will  
shift “from static roles and processes  
to dynamic, multidisciplinary, outcome-focused reconfigurable teams” by  
2024.<sup><a href="#notes">4</a></sup> COVID-19 seems to have further  
exacerbated and accelerated these trends.  
A McKinsey report suggests that the  
pandemic has required some 12% to 25%  
more workers to switch occupations due  
to these role shifts. The greatest impact  
appears to be in advanced economies  
in which workers face greater gaps in skill requirements as high-wage jobs  
grow at the expense of middle- and  
low-wage jobs.<sup><a href="#notes">5</a></sup> It is tempting for L&amp;D  
teams to focus upon the near-term needs  
of their organisations. However, given  
these trends, developing and readying  
employees for an exit could mean the  
difference between an efficient, effective  
organisation with a good brand reputation  
and a dysfunctional one.</p>  
  
<p>An important implication of these first  
two trends is that the workforce itself will  
be more fragmented than ever before:  
in addition to purely demographic  
(e.g., age) differences, the proportion  
of traditional full-time employees is  
likely to be reduced. Instead, interns,  
trainees/apprentices, part-time workers,  
employees on flexible schedules, short-term or project-based contract staff, and  
even community members, are all likely  
to become significant components of our  
workforce. The Public Service will not be  
immune to these shifts. Such changes  
impose the challenge of supporting a  
diverse range of workers in their L&amp;D  
needs and in developing and maintaining  
a workforce that functions coherently  
as one organisation.</p>

<h3 class="boxheader">Blurring Lines between Personal and Professional Life</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>A Gartner study shows that "three-quarters of employees expect their employer to  
take a stance on current societal or cultural issues, even if those issues have nothing to  
do with their employer”,<sup>1</sup> and that "68% of employees would consider quitting their  
current job and working with an organisation with a stronger viewpoint on the social  
issues that matter most to them”.<sup>2</sup></p>  
<p>An IDC report also predicts that “35% of knowledge and frontline workers will consider  
social, environmental, and humanitarian actions as key criteria to employment  
decisions”.<sup>3

<p>Third, researchers and experts see a  
blurring of lines between the personal and  
professional spheres. Many individuals  
within organisations are now unafraid  
of voicing differing views and opinions  
about what they value and stand for.  
There are also internal and external  
expectations for organisations to take a  
stance on socio-political issues as well as  
expectations on senior leaders to know  
how to navigate and guide staff on what  
the organisation values (e.g., how the  
organisation views gender representation,  
data transparency, or climate change  
and environmental issues). Research also  
shows that an organisation’s support  
for certain social movements, which  
is often associated with their staff or  
leaders’ support for specific causes,  
can enhance their public image and  
that of their products and services.<sup><a href="#notes">6</a></sup>  
L&amp;D has a role in helping workers at  
every level pick up the competencies  
needed to negotiate this new, complex,  
and potentially fraught landscape.</p>  
  
<p>A fourth trend is that learning is  
becoming a central piece of career and  
organisational development, moved by  
the same technological forces that shape  
how business is being conducted.<sup><a href="#notes">7</a></sup> With  
online platforms, deeper personalisation  
and better user experience becoming  
commonplace in daily life, it is unsurprising  
that learners expect the same conveniences  
from their learning experiences as well.  
Private sector learning providers are  
increasingly streamlining their platforms  
and offerings, while data-driven machine  
learning and artificial intelligence (AI)  
are offering new opportunities to  
identify, predict and support the needs  
of learners. Learning and development  
in the public sector must keep up with  
these technological advances.</p>  
  
<p>Most L&amp;D teams are only beginning  
to reap the benefits of these new  
opportunities. Here, the pandemic  
has been an accelerator, prompting  
a rapid rise in digital adoption rates  
along with increased leadership focus  
on capability development to help staff  
manage disruption and adapt to new  
organisational needs.<sup><a href="#notes">8</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#notes">9</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>But the playing field is not level, even in  
the public sector: resource-rich agencies  
with enough critical mass can invest  
heavily in these areas, while smaller  
agencies that run on leaner budgets  
are forced to make tough trade-offs  
between keeping operations afloat and  
supporting L&amp;D efforts. Because these  
efforts are increasingly recognised as  
being crucial for the sustainability and  
longevity of organisations, L&amp;D teams  
are pressed to seek out solutions for their  
organisations. These solutions are likely  
to differ greatly between organisations,  
but because of this pressure, L&amp;D  
teams are at risk of being trapped in  
a ‘firefighting’ stance of reacting to  
ever-changing organisational learning  
and development demands, instead of  
approaching their agency’s needs in a  
strategic and forward-looking manner.</p>  
  
<p>Given these intersecting trends, it is  
critical for L&amp;D leaders, practitioners  
and teams within public sector agencies  
to take stock of and define the role that  
they can play in shaping the future of  
their organisations. L&amp;D teams could  
look first to their own development,  
experimenting on and among themselves  
with the approaches they hope to apply  
more broadly in their organisations,  
tapping on the wider L&amp;D community  
for support, and striving to be on the  
leading edge of strategic decision-making in their own organisations.  
Organisational leaders must also  
complete the equation by supporting  
and allying with their L&amp;D teams so that  
their agencies can be well-prepared in  
light of emerging shifts.</p>  
  
<h3>Shaping the Future: Four Key Steps</h3>  
  
<p>With these four trends and their challenges  
in mind, a community of L&amp;D leaders  
and practitioners in Singapore<sup><a href="#notes">10</a></sup> have  
discussed and proposed several ways in  
which L&amp;D teams in the Public Service  
should respond, broadly focusing on  
four key steps:<br>  
<br>  
<img title="Future of L&amp;amp;D\_diagram" style="vertical-align: middle;" src="/images/Ethos_Images/Ethos_Issue_23/Future_Of_ld_Diagram.jpg" alt="Future of L&amp;amp;D\_diagram"></p>  
  
<h3>STEP 1: Establish a Strategic Voice in the Organisation</h3>  
  
<p>The L&amp;D community was united in its  
assessment that L&amp;D teams need to  
exercise a strategic ‘voice’ to influence  
organisational strategy. To wield this  
voice with authority, L&amp;D teams must be  
familiar with and well-informed about the  
organisation’s existing workforce capacity.  
They must be able to distinguish potential  
bright spots ripe for capacity building  
from those where ‘borrowing or botting’  
strategies are more fitting. They must  
keep abreast of advances and trends in  
learning that might accelerate capacity development in their organisation. With a  
well-honed understanding of current and  
emerging organisational challenges and  
opportunities, L&amp;D teams will be better  
able to offer a view of organisational  
strategy through the lens of current  
and potential capabilities.</p>  
  
<p>As with almost every facet of a  
contemporary organisation, the ability  
to influence organisational strategy,  
especially when there are competing  
demands and considerations, will  
depend substantially on the quality  
of data and data analysis that is at  
hand. Data about current workforce  
profile and capacity, potential returns  
on capacity development investment,  
and an understanding of organisational  
needs are all examples of factors that  
could determine organisational strategy  
and direction if properly considered by  
L&amp;D teams. However, this means that  
L&amp;D teams must grow their current data  
collection, management and analytics  
abilities, and perhaps even do so ahead  
of the rest of their organisation.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
L&amp;D teams need to exercise a strategic ‘voice’ to influence organisational strategy…through the lens of current and potential capabilities.  
</p>  
 </div>  
  
<h3>STEP 2: Champion the Human: People and Talent</h3>  
  
<p>While talent development has always been a key driver of organisational  
strategy, the fact is that the worker-employer relationship has changed,  
as the key trends above indicate. L&amp;D teams must champion the human in  
the system: continually remind their organisations that employees should  
be valued and invested in, beyond their immediate utility to the  
organisation.</p>  
  
<p>The concept of ‘stewardship of the whole person’ resonates strongly with  
the L&amp;D community. This is the idea that L&amp;D teams are bestowed the privilege  
of supporting the development of employees beyond the needs of their current vocation, and should equip them with the necessary competencies to navigate the future successfully and  
be resilient in the face of change. It is recognising that employees have the potential to contribute their talents to benefit the wider community and economy, and organisations should develop their human resources with this in mind, regardless of their current or potential tenure with their current  
organisation. Organisations that fail to see themselves as corporate citizens of the society they operate in and structure themselves in a way that allows for skilled workers to permeate in and out easily, run the risk of devaluing their brand and being seen as a less desirable employer.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
Employees have the potential to contribute their talents to benefit the wider community and economy.  
</p>  
  
</div>  
  
<h3>STEP 3: Nurture a Healthy Organisational L&amp;D Culture</h3>  
  
<p>Leaders at every level play a significant  
role in setting the organisational  
context and culture of learning.<sup><a href="#notes">11</a></sup> L&amp;D  
teams must continually draw their  
top leadership’s attention to L&amp;D  
priorities, and gain their active support  
for a visible and well-articulated  
organisational L&amp;D culture. L&amp;D teams  
should also work with line leaders  
across the organisation to secure their  
buy-in and commitment, as these are  
hugely influential in communicating  
and implementing organisational L&amp;D  
policies and programmes on the ground.</p>  
  
<p>The L&amp;D community in particular felt  
that there should be a review of the  
metrics currently used to measure  
learning activities and their influence  
in shaping L&amp;D culture. There should  
be a shift from simplistic, less pertinent  
metrics—such as training satisfaction  
or training hours—towards more  
strategically meaningful measures,  
such as whether workers have received  
training in areas that did not exist  
a given number of years before.  
Furthermore, performance indicators  
meant to track learning should not  
inadvertently discourage favourable  
behaviours such as experimentation  
and learning from failure.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
There should be a shift from simplistic, less pertinent metrics towards more strategically meaningful measures.  
</p>  
  
</div>  
  
<h3>STEP 4: Redefine What Learning Looks Like in Organisations</h3>  
  
<p>For organisations to benefit from the  
advancements and developments in the  
L&amp;D field, L&amp;D teams must continuously  
challenge existing practices and introduce  
new learning ideas and practices. Most  
fundamental of all is the question of what  
learning is or should be.</p>  
  
<p>The L&amp;D community identified three ways  
in which the concept of ‘learning’ needed  
to be expanded upon:</p>  
  
<p><strong>(a) </strong>Beyond the traditional understanding  
of ‘learning’ as what is gained through  
formal training, organisations need to  
understand that the more significant  
part of learning actually takes place in  
the flow of work. Furthermore, because  
of the diversity of work that employees  
need to take on, centrally planned  
cohort-based learning may become  
increasingly unwieldy; self-directed  
individually-customised learning could  
prove the better approach. We must  
also acknowledge that there are social  
aspects that help individuals learn and  
retain knowledge and skills. Creating  
a learning environment is therefore  
not only about access to training, but  
also about cultivating healthy learning  
behaviours and habits, and providing  
encouragement and support to apply  
learning.</p>  
  
<p><strong>(b) </strong>Beyond the traditional understanding  
that learning is an individual endeavour to  
develop individual capacity, organisations  
should recognise that team learning to  
develop team and/or organisational  
capacity is equally, if not more, important.  
As organisations increasingly rely on teams  
to carry out strategies and operational  
tasks, team learning is a “key mechanism  
by which learning organisations can  
become strategically and operationally  
adaptive and responsive”.<sup><a href="#notes">12</a></sup></p>  
  
<p><strong>(c) </strong>Beyond the traditional understanding  
that each organisation is responsible  
for identifying and attending to its own  
learning needs and is reliant on itself to  
do so, organisations should also look  
to identify collective learning needs of  
the wider industry or ecosystem and  
develop their employees to meet those  
needs. Despite the risks and difficulties  
of doing so, expanding learning beyond  
the confines of the organisation is one  
of the few ways in which an organisation  
can keep abreast of future-oriented and  
far-reaching trends. This is especially  
true in the Public Service, where the  
nature of challenges is such that they  
cut across organisational boundaries.  
Partnerships among L&amp;D teams  
within a shared ecosystem will be  
essential in creating and sustaining  
inter-organisational learning that can  
take the form, as discussed above, not  
just of training programmes but of  
collaborative projects, work exchanges,  
and other formats.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>  
  
<p>The ideas presented here imply significant  
shifts in how L&amp;D is perceived and  
structured in public sector organisations  
today. Whereas L&amp;D teams have tended  
to be very lean and operational in most  
agencies, this article suggests that the  
L&amp;D function of the future would be  
most effective when integrated well  
with what are typically considered  
human resources (e.g., recruitment  
and deployment) and organisation  
development functions. With L&amp;D becoming  
a central pillar for the sustainability  
and growth of an organisation, a well-supported and strategic L&amp;D team will  
be instrumental in helping to shepherd  
organisations through a complex and fast-changing future.</p>
