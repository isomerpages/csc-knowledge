<em><small>ETHOS Issue 23, October 2021</small></em>
<img src="/images/Cropped_images/Ethos_Issue_23/23_Banner_Nuturing_Future_Leaders.jpg">

  
<p>If leaders are judged by how they lead in  
context, then the business of developing  
public sector leaders must account for the  
operational and organisational environment  
into which they will transfer their learning.  
With the increasing complexity of today’s  
challenges, however, we see a shift in the  
role of <em>positional leaders </em>(defined here  
as those formally appointed to positions  
of authority by the organisation), with a  
growing emphasis on achieving results  
through supporting and developing  
officers, and adapting the organisation  
to context.</p>  
  
<p>Leadership development approaches  
will likewise have to go beyond building  
up the individual leader’s capacity,  
towards nurturing the capacities of  
their teams and organisations. There  
will also need to be a focus on building  
new capacities that enable leaders to  
foster leadership and innovation in  
others at work.</p>  
  
<h3>RETHINKING THE ROLE OF POSITIONAL LEADERS</h3>  
  
<p>The changing context in which  
leaders now operate demands that  
organisations redefine how they think  
about positional leaders. Our traditional  
conception of the ‘<strong>leader-as-hero</strong>’<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup> —positional leaders as charismatic heroes who are fully in control and who provide  
all the plans and insightful answers—may  
no longer serve us well. Instead, we need  
to think of positional leaders as hosts  
—people who provide the conditions,  
processes and resources for others to  
come together for a common purpose  
in addressing a complex problem at  
hand. This ‘<strong>leader-as-host</strong>’ perspective  
acknowledges that a leader does  
not have all the answers, but instead  
finds ways to access and unleash the  
collective intelligence and energies  
that reside in their teams and networks.<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>In order to play this role well, positional  
leaders need to (i) sense-make and  
sense-give in order to provide clarity  
and direction, (ii) create the conditions  
that enable innovative and adaptive  
responses to emerge throughout the  
organisation, and (iii) work well with  
other leaders towards collective goals.</p>

<h3 class="title">THE CHANGING CONTEXT FOR LEADERSHIP</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p><strong>GREATER COMPLEXITY AND ACCELERATED CHANGE</strong></p>  
<p>Societies around the world are beset with an operating  
environment of increasing complexity, interdependence,  
volatility, accelerated change, and ‘wicked’ problems that cut  
across conventional boundaries.<sup>1, 2, 3, 4</sup> A prime example is the  
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Future challenges, such as that  
of climate change, will call for similar collaboration, with leaders  
who are able to work across disciplinary and administrative  
lines, with incomplete information in a dynamic situation.</p>  
<p><strong>KNOWLEDGE WORK IN THE INFORMATION AGE</strong></p>  
<p>In the Information Age, knowledge workers, including  
many public officers, ‘think for a living’<sup>5</sup> and are engaged  
in ‘non-routine’ work that calls for problem-solving skills,  
and critical and creative thinking.<sup>6<sup> </sup></sup>A different type of  
leadership is needed to harness the wealth of expertise in  
and across organisations. While leaders define the aims to  
be achieved, it is up to skilled officers to detail the steps  
needed to realise timely solutions.</p>  
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN PARADIGM SHIFTS</strong></p>  
<p>Digitalisation and technological advancements have disrupted  
established business models, but have also surfaced new  
opportunities for improving public service. Leaders need the  
discernment and foresight to prepare their organisations to  
adapt and leverage these developments to enhance their  
operations and further the public good.</p>  
<p><strong>GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN VALUES</strong></p>  
<p>A digitally native new cohort has grown up with worldviews,  
aspirations and motivations that differ from those of previous  
generations.<sup>7</sup> They will expect different qualities from  
their own leaders and are likely to enact different forms of  
leadership once they assume these roles.</p>  
<p><strong>LEADERSHIP AT ALL LEVELS</strong></p>  
<p>While leadership has traditionally been expected from people  
in appointed positions of authority, we now see it being  
enacted by those not in formal leadership positions but who  
nevertheless provide influence and direction. With ongoing  
transformational efforts affecting hierarchical structures  
and more team-based operations, leadership capability  
and practice now reside at every level of an organisation.</p>

<h3>1. SENSE-MAKING AND SENSE-GIVING</h3>  
  
<p>In times of complexity, leaders need to  
engage in sense-making to interpret and  
explain unpredictable or ambiguous  
events in their world.<sup><a href="#notes">3</a></sup> Furthermore,  
they need to shape others’ sense-making processes and outcomes by  
sense-giving: articulating a coherent,  
understandable and tolerable narrative  
of this complex reality.<sup><a href="#notes">4 </a></sup> But while leaders  
should provide a clear narrative in their  
sense-giving, it is not helpful for them to  
stick to a single, rigid narrative. Instead,  
they need to flex the narrative in order  
to address the divergent concerns and  
priorities of those involved.<sup><a href="#notes">5</a></sup> Successful  
sense-giving can rally everyone around a core purpose.</p>  
  
<h3>2. ENABLING INNOVATION</h3>  
  
<p>To tap on the collective competence of  
their team, or of the organisation as a  
whole, positional leaders must create  
conditions that enable innovation.  
Positional leaders, by virtue of the formal  
power they hold, are well-placed to  
establish organisational culture, systems  
and processes. Taken together, leadership  
actions such as championing the need for  
change,<sup><a href="#notes">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#notes">7</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#notes">8</a></sup> strengthening connections  
among people and organisational units  
for generative conversations, building  
a culture of psychological safety and  
learning,<sup><a href="#notes">9</a></sup> and empowering staff to  
initiate ideas, can enable innovative  
responses to emerge throughout the  
organisation.<sup><a href="#notes">10</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#notes">11</a></sup> In addition, positional  
leaders need to define the boundaries  
of innovation—by being clear on what  
the vision of the organisation is and  
what values should guide everyone’s  
behaviours.</p>  
  
<h3>3. COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP</h3>  
  
<p>It is becoming increasingly clear that  
leaders do not work in silos. As issues  
become more cross-cutting and  
complex, leaders need to collaborate  
with other leaders. Senior leadership is  
increasingly recognised as ‘collective  
work’,<sup><a href="#notes">12</a></sup> with the apex executive team  
in organisations forming an important  
collective entity. Thus, leaders also  
need to know how to work together  
with other leaders for the greater good.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
While leaders should provide a clear narrative in their sense-giving, it is not  
helpful for them to stick to a single, rigid narrative. They need to flex the narrative  
in order to address the divergent concerns and priorities of those involved.  
</p>  
  
</div>  
  
<h3>WHAT SHOULD LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FOCUS ON?</h3>  
  
<p>As the role of positional leaders changes,  
leadership development approaches  
need to shift in tandem. We believe  
that leadership development should  
focus firstly on the <strong>intrapersonal  
competencies </strong>that enable an individual  
to lead himself or herself, then nurture  
<strong>interpersonal competencies</strong> that  
enable the individual to lead others, and  
hence <strong>lead organisations</strong>, taking into  
consideration the broader <strong>leadership  
context</strong>.</p>  
  
<h3>LEADING SELF</h3>  
  
<p>In the new leadership context, positional  
leaders must re-examine and reconstruct  
their <strong>leader identity</strong>, i.e., what an  
individual defines leadership to be, and  
the extent to which they consider such  
a leader role to be an important aspect  
of who they are.<sup><a href="#notes">13</a></sup> Being a leader-as-host  
with a more collective orientation may  
run counter to their implicit theory of  
good leadership and the individualistic  
leader-as-hero behaviours they are  
more accustomed to seeing in other  
leaders, and that they themselves are  
more comfortable displaying. Shifting  
this mindset is challenging as it requires  
leaders to reflect and introspect, and  
then embrace a new identity. It entails  
being vulnerable and being comfortable  
sharing power and control with others,  
instead of being the one with all the  
answers and who makes all the decisions.  
This can be particularly difficult if social  
and organisational norms continue  
to expect and reward those who are  
leaders-as-heroes. Nonetheless, as we  
behave in ways that are aligned with  
our self-identity, a mindset shift is the  
prerequisite for motivating positional  
leaders to develop new behaviours.</p>  
  
<p>A core set of evergreen competencies  
are <strong>meta-skills</strong> that enable leaders to  
be more effective. In particular, these  
include having a learning orientation  
and being willing and able to learn  
from experiences. Experience is at the  
heart of leadership development, yet  
people may go through an experience  
without learning anything from it,<sup><a href="#notes">14</a></sup>,<sup><a href="#notes">15</a></sup> or  
learning the wrong lessons.<sup><a href="#notes">16</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#notes">17</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>Another focal area for positional leaders  
is v<strong>ertical cognitive development</strong>—  
helping leaders expand their thinking  
and develop a more sophisticated  
mode of thinking that can help them  
grapple with the uncertainties and  
diversities they will face in their new  
role. As studies show,<sup><a href="#notes">18</a></sup> early in our  
cognitive development as adults, we  
are inclined to see things in black and  
white terms, to conform to authority  
and the status quo, and to seek to  
be aligned with others. Later on, we  
become more holistic and flexible in our  
thinking, until we advance to become  
independent thinkers who can see broader  
systems, patterns and connections.  
We then become more comfortable  
with ambiguity and better able to shift  
flexibly across multiple perspectives,  
and to adjust our opinions to account  
for new information. Such expanded  
cognitive structures contribute to the  
leader-as-host role, by helping leaders  
better harness divergent views in their  
team while holding a ‘big picture’  
systems view.<br>

</p>  
  
<p style="text-align: center;" class="small-text"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Focus of Leadership  
Development Competencies</p>  
  
<p>Given the changing context of positional  
leadership, some intrapersonal  
competencies that have long been  
core to leadership development should  
continue to be emphasised. These  
include<strong> values</strong> that ensure the practice  
of leadership is underpinned by a strong  
moral compass and are aligned with the  
organisation’s ethos.<sup><a href="#notes">19</a></sup> For Singapore’s  
Public Service leaders, this means being  
grounded in the principles of integrity,  
service and excellence. Public Service  
leaders need to have a stewardship  
mindset, so that they use their positional  
power to make decisions that are for  
the long-term collective good of the  
nation.<sup><a href="#notes">20</a></sup> <strong>Emotional competencies</strong>  
that enable leaders to be aware of  
their own strengths and weaknesses,  
to be mindful of and to manage their  
behaviours and impact on others,  
will be vital to the facilitative role of  
leader-as-host.<sup><a href="#notes">21</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>The many demands and stresses on leaders  
have never been greater, and leaders  
need to develop personal <strong>resilience</strong> to  
sustain their effectiveness in the longer  
term. This involves being able to handle  
pressure, to recognise and reduce the  
impact that stress has on oneself, and  
to adapt and bounce back in the face  
of challenging circumstances, while  
taking steps to maintain a stable mental  
wellbeing. Those able to do so will be  
more productive, make better decisions,  
have more positive energy, and have  
a more positive impact on the people  
they work with.<sup><a href="#notes">22</a></sup> In modelling healthy  
resilience in the face of vulnerability  
and stress, leaders can also inspire their  
teams and organisations to do the same.</p>  
  
<h3>LEADING OTHERS</h3>  
  
<p>Leadership development will need  
to focus on building competence in  
leading others in a more distributed and  
facilitative manner. A <strong>shared leadership  
</strong>approach to team processes can enable  
a more agile and successful response  
to complex challenges. Leadership has  
shifted away from the traditional practice  
where control or authority resides in  
a single individual; it has become a  
dynamic social process in which influence  
is distributed within a team,<sup><a href="#notes">23</a></sup> geared  
towards shared goals. Such a process  
often involves “peer, or lateral, influence  
and at other times involves upward or  
downward hierarchical influence”.<sup><a href="#notes">24</a></sup>  
Positional leaders must be willing to  
empower others to lead, and receive  
guidance and direction from peers and  
subordinates where relevant.<sup><a href="#notes">25</a></sup> To allow  
this to occur, leaders must develop  
leadership capabilities in their team  
members and create the conditions  
for team members to step up to the  
responsibility of leadership.</p>  
  
<p>To allow for the emergence of collective  
leadership, leaders must also work to  
develop <strong>psychological safety</strong> within  
their team environment. Research has  
shown that individuals perform more  
interpersonally risky behaviours (such  
as asking for help, admitting mistakes or  
ignorance, suggesting improvements or  
taking initiative) when they are confident  
these will be taken in the right spirit  
and not harm their self-image, status or  
career. <a href="#notes"><sup>26</sup></a><sup>, <a href="#notes">27</a>,  
<a href="#notes">28</a>, <a href="#notes">29</a>,  
<a href="#notes">30</a>, <a href="#notes">31</a></sup>  
Furthermore, psychological safety has been positively  
associated with learning behaviours,<sup><a href="#notes">32</a></sup>  
which is in turn conducive to continuous  
learning in an ever-changing and  
uncertain environment.<sup><a href="#notes">33</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>While leaders have perhaps the most  
significant impact in establishing  
psychological safety, <sup><a href="#notes">34</a></sup> it is not an  
easy task: leaders must also <strong>hold the  
tension between creating safety while  
upholding performance</strong>. Nevertheless,  
how leaders support and encourage  
their teams in the face of failure sets  
a salient example. If a leader adopts  
a defensive or punitive stance, team  
members are less likely to feel that  
it is safe or worthwhile to speak up,  
compared to a leader who welcomes  
questions, suggestions or challenges.<sup><a href="#notes">35</a></sup>  
Leaders need to demonstrate that  
they are accessible to their followers,  
model openness and vulnerability, and  
in the face of failure will displace blame  
with curiosity, solicit input, and reward  
innovative thinking and ideas.<sup><a href="#notes">36</a></sup>  
</p>  
  
<h3>LEADING ORGANISATIONS</h3>  
  
<p>In an increasingly complex and dynamic  
environment, successful organisational  
transformations are not the result of  
positional leaders dictating and pushing  
through their own agenda, but the  
outcome of leaders-as-hosts creating  
conditions that encourage and energise  
people to contribute to and grow from the  
transformation process. In other words,  
it is about “doing change with people  
rather than doing change to them”.<sup><a href="#notes">37</a></sup>  
Successful organisational leadership  
is about knowing how to co-create  
a vision with others, build emotional  
alignment between people and the  
organisational agenda, establish co-ownership of organisational strategies,  
shape organisational culture and shared  
values, and provide motivation and  
inspiration to the entire organisation.<sup><a href="#notes">38</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>The increasing complexity and  
interconnectedness of challenges  
will demand collaboration across  
organisational and sectoral boundaries.  
Leaders need to work collaboratively  
across boundaries, with a whole-of-government mindset that focuses on  
collective stewardship of Singapore’s  
interests, even if they supersede  
organisational or personal goals. This calls  
for a willingness to lead or follow, to best  
ensure national objectives are reached.  
Not only must leaders internalise this  
identity of <strong>collective leadership</strong>, but they  
must <em>also role model it and promote it  
in their organisations, create alignment  
with broader mission, vision and values</em>,  
while sharing the bigger picture with their  
people and clarifying their place within it.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
Successful organisational transformations are the  
outcome of leaders-as-hosts creating conditions that  
encourage and energise people to contribute to and grow from the  
transformation process.  
</p>  
  
</div>  
  
<h3>FROM DEVELOPING POSITIONAL LEADERS TO  
BUILDING LEADERSHIP CAPABILITIES THROUGHOUT  
THE ORGANISATION: RECENT APPROACHES</h3>  
  
<p>To promote leadership behaviours  
throughout an organisation beyond  
those in positional authority, the scope of  
leadership development must broaden.  
Leadership development interventions  
have traditionally focused on equipping  
high potential officers and existing  
leaders for leadership positions. Given the  
increasingly complex and novel nature  
of leadership challenges, harnessing  
collective talent across teams and  
organisations requires all staff to step  
up as leaders when needed, based on  
their unique competencies. Hence,  
the intrapersonal and interpersonal  
competencies that apply to positional  
leaders could also be relevant to others  
in the organisation, while positional  
leaders have the additional role of  
nurturing their people and creating the  
conditions for leadership to emerge  
in others.</p>  
  
<div class="break">  
  
<p class="break1">  
Positional leaders have the  
additional role of nurturing their  
people and creating the conditions  
for leadership to emerge in others.  
</p>  
  
</div>  
  
<p>This perspective highlights the significance  
of three broad trends in leadership  
development that have gained momentum  
in recent years:</p>  
  
<p><strong>1. Integrating different avenues for  
developing leadership, leveraging  
data and technology</strong></p>  
  
<p>The 70:20:10 model has been widely  
used to guide leadership development,  
with 70% of development occurring  
through on-the-job assignments, 20%  
through working with and learning  
from other people, and 10% through  
formal programmes. The ratios may  
vary from person to person, depending  
on their specific developmental needs  
and career stage.<sup><a href="#notes">39</a></sup> Nonetheless, the  
70:20:10 model offers a convenient  
shorthand for thinking about the different  
avenues for developing the leadership  
competencies described above.</p>  
  
<p>Leadership development can be  
maximised when different types  
of developmental experiences are  
integrated in a thoughtful manner,  
rather than pursued in isolation.  
Challenging job assignments can  
trigger learning as they require  
individuals to build up competencies  
to meet the demands of a new role.  
Particularly during the first 6 to 12  
months, when new leaders are more  
aware of their developmental needs  
and more eager to develop themselves,  
attending relevant formal programmes  
can help close competency gaps;  
and practising these competencies  
on a day-to-day basis will further  
build expertise.<sup><a href="#notes">40</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#notes">41</a></sup>,<sup><a href="#notes"> 42</a></sup> Colleagues and  
peers can further catalyse learning  
by providing guidance, advice and  
feedback. They may also serve as  
social support to help leaders to  
benefit from challenging assignments  
without feeling overwhelmed.<sup><a href="#notes">43</a></sup> Thus,  
a leadership development approach  
integrating learning from on-the-job  
assignments, formal programmes,  
and other people, can increase the  
developmental value that a leader  
extracts from a job assignment, because  
of the complementary and mutually  
reinforcing effects of learning from  
these different avenues.</p>  
  
<p>Leveraging data and technology could  
make the integration of learning from  
these different avenues even more  
efficient and impactful. For instance,  
data on the experience, strengths and  
developmental needs of an individual  
could be used to determine the job  
assignment that would be most  
beneficial at a particular stage in  
that leader’s career. Developmental  
programmes could be conducted  
virtually and interspersed with on-the-job experiences; digital learning  
resources could be accessible anytime  
and anywhere on a just-in-time  
basis; algorithms could be used to  
recommend learning resources that  
are most relevant; and virtual support  
networks could be readily formed with  
relevant others regardless of their  
geographical locations. As technology  
advances, there will be other ways to  
better integrate learning from different  
avenues in future.</p>  
  
<div class="break">

<h3 class="title">LEADERSHIP TRANSFORMATION IN THE SINGAPORE PUBLIC SERVICE</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>The Singapore Public Service is driving leadership transformation and development  
across different career stages, as well as in leadership teams within and across  
agencies. This involves supporting leaders to ‘Know, Grow and Contribute’, by  
raising leaders’ self-awareness, implementing competency-based development  
and deploying leaders for optimal impact.</p>  
<p>Public officers in middle-manager and higher positions complete a 360-exercise  
based on the Leadership Competency Framework (LCF) for the Singapore  
Public Service, to derive a better understanding of their leadership at work from  
feedback. This is followed by individual or team-based coaching. The LCF identifies  
specific intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies, as well as contextual  
understanding, required of Singapore’s Public Service leaders.</p>  
<p>The Civil Service College (CSC) offers leadership milestone programmes catering  
to the public sector leadership life cycle, as officers develop from individual  
contributors and middle managers to senior leaders (up to Chief Executive/  
Deputy Secretary levels). Participation is timed to match each officer’s transition  
to leadership roles. Each programme’s curriculum is being mapped to the LCF  
to ensure that leadership development efforts target the competencies most  
important for the Singapore Public Service.</p>  
<p>CSC has also started experimenting with restructuring  
some leadership programmes to better incorporate  
learning experiences from work (the 70%) into  
formal programme sessions (the 10%) and vice  
versa. For support networks, coaching and peer  
learning groups (the 20%) are offered as part of  
the milestone programmes.</p>  
<p>A dedicated mobile learning app lets participants  
access curated, bite-size learning modules for  
just-in-time learning. Examples of these include  
the Directors’ Developmental Experience and  
the Leading Transformation in a Disruptive  
World programme, which aim to support leaders  
in leadership transition and team-based work  
respectively</p>

<p><strong>2. Encouraging individuals to be  
active designers of their own  
development</strong></p>  
  
<p>Traditionally, individuals have been  
relatively passive consumers of leadership  
development interventions. They attend  
leadership development programmes  
where the curriculum has been curated  
for them, networks of peers are created  
to support them, and developmental  
experiences assigned to them.</p>  
  
<p>Although the organisation can and  
should do its part to support leadership  
development, individuals can be more  
proactive in managing their own  
development and building up habits of  
learning from their own experience, so  
that the learning is much more suited  
to their unique needs. Adults learn best  
when the learning is perceived to be  
relevant and practical in helping with  
real-life situations.<sup><a href="#notes">44</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#notes">45</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>Individuals can be active designers of  
their own development in different ways.  
For example, they could co-create their  
leadership development curriculum, be  
more proactive in identifying suitable  
developmental avenues, or take the  
initiative to build their own support  
network—and some of these experiences  
and resources could be from outside  
the work context as well, offering a  
broader perspective.</p>  
  
  
  
  
  
  
<div class="containerbox">  
  
  
<h3 class="title">SELF-DIRECTED AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING IN THE LEADERSHIP MILESTONE PROGRAMMES</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>CSC’s leadership milestone programmes  
include <em>protected time</em> to pursue self-directed learning, and <em>white spaces</em> in which  
participants decide on the scope, format,  
and speakers by tapping on collective  
wisdom or connections for their learning  
as a cohort. There are also pick-and-mix  
segments where participants decide what  
content would be most relevant to them (as  
guided by data from their 360-exercises).  
Finally, participants choose the scopes of  
their <em>capstone projects</em> for meaningful  
experiential learning.</p>  
<p> In the senior-level milestone programmes  
(i.e., the Senior Management Programme and  
the Leaders in Administration Programme),  
participants experiment with and act on  
initiatives that may be useful and impactful  
to the Public Service as a system. At  
the junior level (i.e., the Foundation  
Course), the project initiates  
participants’ experience of  
navigating the system to bring  
forward and materialise an  
idea, with a greater focus on  
learning through the process  
instead of achieving results.</p>  
  
  
  
</div>  
  
  
  
  
  
<p><strong>3. Leaders playing a more active  
role in developing other leaders</strong></p>  
  
<p>An important source of learning for  
many leaders is their own <strong>supervisor</strong>,  
and organisations could do more to  
encourage their leaders to grow other  
leaders.<sup><a href="#notes">46</a></sup> Within their team, leaders can  
catalyse and support their team members’  
development by assigning and designing  
challenging work experiences; helping  
them to identify learning opportunities  
and set personal learning goals for work  
assignments; encouraging them to  
develop new competencies that would  
enable them to better contribute to the  
organisation; helping them to identify  
situations where they can apply their new  
competencies; teaching them important  
3 lessons; providing trust and autonomy  
and support; offering timely feedback  
on their behaviours; and providing  
affirmation when the new competencies  
are displayed effectively.<sup><a href="#notes">47</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>In addition, leaders can serve as <strong>coaches  
or mentors</strong> to the next generation of  
leaders in the organisation. This builds  
greater leadership capability throughout  
the organisation, in terms of not only  
leadership competencies but also  
leadership ethos. This can also build the  
leaders’ own leadership effectiveness by  
prompting reflections of what leadership  
means to them, consolidating what they  
have learnt from their own leadership  
experience, and honing their skills in  
communicating with others. Thus, leaders  
building leaders could raise the level of  
leadership in the entire organisation.</p>  
  
  
  
  
  
  
<div class="containerbox">  
  
  
<h3 class="title">LEADERS BUILDING LEADERS IN THE SINGAPORE PUBLIC SERVICE</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Since leadership is learnt largely by learning from others, there has been a renewed  
emphasis on the role leaders play in shaping other leaders.</p>  
<p>In the Singapore Public Service, supervisors are expected to care for, develop and inspire  
staff. This includes regularly providing staff with constructive and timely feedback on  
learning/performance and guidance for longer-term career development. Within CSC’s  
leadership milestone programmes, senior public sector leaders serve as Programme  
Mentors. Acting as leadership role models, they guide younger leaders, and share their  
knowledge and experiences at briefings and dialogues.</p>  
<p>CSC also offers coaching and mentoring workshops, as well as the ‘Leaders Building  
Leaders’ (LBL) onboarding workshops, to help foster a Public Service-wide culture of  
leaders growing other leaders in a more agile and sustainable way. The LBL approach  
identifies, develops and deploys experienced middle managers, known as ‘Learning  
Guides’, to develop first-time managers within their organisations through small group  
blended learning. Plans to pilot this approach with more senior levels of leadership (e.g.,  
Heads of Functions) are in progress.</p>  
  
  
  
</div>  
  
  
  
  
  
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>  
  
<p>The Singapore Public Service must  
remain responsive and adaptive to the  
ever-changing context that it operates  
in, which in turn means that our  
approach to leadership and leadership  
development must be equally adaptive.</p>  
  
<p>How organisations view leadership has  
evolved with changing expectations on  
positional leaders, with leaders expected  
to develop new competencies and  
display new behaviours.</p>  
  
<p>As a result, we have placed greater focus  
on leadership development that engages  
with a larger talent base in the Public  
Service, and that integrates different  
avenues of leadership development,  
leveraging technology and data, self-directed learning, and leaders developing  
other leaders. Leaders themselves must  
manage the tension of performing  
and learning in the flow of work and  
when to play the role of ‘hero’ or ‘host’,  
depending on circumstances.</p>  
  
<p>This shift will not happen overnight. Just  
like the leaders we hope to develop,  
we will have to learn from experience,  
adapt and be agile in our innovations,  
and harness collective efforts towards  
the common cause of developing future-ready leaders in the Singapore Public  
Service.</p>
