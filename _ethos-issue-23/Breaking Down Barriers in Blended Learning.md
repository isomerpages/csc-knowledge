<h3>BLENDED LEARNING—A BEHAVIOURAL CHALLENGE</h3>  
  
<p>While online modes of learning have  
become much more prevalent in the field  
of corporate training, most businesses and  
training institutions have not abandoned  
traditional face-to-face modes in favour  
of online learning. Instead, <em>blended  
learning</em>—bringing the best of both  
online and in-person modes of learning  
together—has emerged as a popular  
approach. However, implementing  
blended learning for adult learners is not  
straightforward. Even though it enables  
learning to take place outside the walls  
of training rooms and grants learners  
autonomy and flexibility to learn at their  
own pace and time, blended learning  
comes with its own challenges.</p>  
  
<p>The Civil Service College (CSC) in  
Singapore has shifted towards more  
blended learning in recent years, as part  
of its efforts to redefine learning. The  
flipped classroom model is a common  
blended learning approach used at CSC.  
This model ‘flips’ the traditional learning  
experience by first introducing pre-course learning materials (e.g., videos, articles) for learners to engage with in their own time, before they attend in-class sessions to discuss and apply this learning.</p>  
  
<p>Similar to working adults who enrol in  
corporate training, CSC participants  
sign up for these courses on their own  
or are nominated by their supervisors  
to attend. The challenges arising from  
blended learning are typically associated  
with pre-course learning. Compared with  
in-class sessions, pre-course learning  
demands more from adult learners,  
because it requires them to:</p>  
  
<p>• be able to learn independently without  
much guidance from the trainer; and</p>  
  
<p>• be motivated to learn independently,  
and to set aside time to complete  
their pre-course learning.</p>  
  
<p>Blended learning also assumes that  
all learners will easily adapt to this  
way of learning and that they have the  
opportunity (time) to complete their  
pre-course learning while managing  
work and personal commitments.  
From our observations, CSC course  
participants have been struggling to  
complete their pre-course learning,  
with completion rates as low as 11% in  
some cases. This is an important issue to  
address, given that pre-course learning  
can affect learning effectiveness during  
in-class sessions.</p>  
  
<p>A Behavioural Insights (BI) approach  
offers a useful lens through which  
to understand learners’ behaviours  
and why they sometimes fall short of  
completing their pre-course learning. A  
team of officers from CSC’s Institute of Governance and Policy (IGP) and Learning  
Futures Group (LFG) conducted a study in  
2021 to identify behavioural barriers and  
enablers affecting pre-course learning.  
Their findings suggest ways to design  
interventions to nudge<sup><a href="#notes">1</a>&nbsp;</sup>more learners  
to complete their pre-course learning.</p>

<h3>UNCOVERING DIFFERENT PRE-COURSE LEARNING BEHAVIOURS</h3>  
  
<p>A total of 291 participants<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup> from CSC’s  
programmes responded to a poll from  
17 May 2021 to 16 July 2021, which asked  
about their ability, motivation and  
opportunity to complete pre-course  
learning.<sup><a href="#notes">3</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>Respondents indicated “agree”, “disagree”,  
“pass” or “undecided” on 27 statements  
(e.g., “I usually complete my pre-course  
learning”). Respondents could also  
contribute their own statements for  
others to vote on. </p>  
  
<p>Using the COM-B model for behavioural  
change, each poll statement was  
designed to uncover one of the three  
factors (<strong>C</strong>apability, <strong>O</strong>pportunity and  
<strong>M</strong>otivation) of <strong>B</strong>ehavioural change (see  
Figure 1):<sup><a href="#notes">4</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#notes">5</a></sup></p>  
  
<p style="text-align: left;">The study identified three main opinion  
groups based on how likely they were  
to complete their pre-course learning.  
The <em>Most Likely Group</em> was the largest  
(51% of all respondents), followed by  
the M<em>oderately Likely Group</em> (29%) and  
lastly, the <em>Least Likely Group </em>(19%) (see  
Figure 2). Unsurprisingly, the <em>Least Likely  
Group </em>struggled with the most barriers  
from all three components of behavioural  
change. In contrast, the <em>Moderately Likely  
Group</em> faced Motivation and Opportunity  
barriers while the <em>Most Likely Group </em>only  
faced Opportunity barriers.<br>

<h3 class="boxheader">What's Stopping Learners from Completing Their Pre-Course Learning?</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p><strong class="yellowstrong">CAPABILITY BARRIER</strong></p>  
<p><strong class="whitetext">1. <em>Least Likely Group</em> faced difficulty in learning independently.</strong></p>  
<p>Around half of the <em>Least Likely Group </em>agreed that they had difficulty in  
learning independently, whereas majority of the <em>Most Likely Group</em> and  
<em>Moderately Likely Group</em> disagreed with that statement. It is thus important to  
identify learners who need greater support for pre-course learning.</p>  
<p><strong class="yellowstrong">OPPORTUNITY BARRIERS</strong></p>  
<p><strong class="whitetext">2. Busyness at work, and intention-action gap are key barriers for  
many learners.</strong></p>  
<p>59% of all respondents, including most of the <em>Least Likely Group</em> and  
<em>Moderately Likely Group</em>, agreed that they were too busy at work to complete  
their pre-course learning. This problem could be further compounded if adult  
learners think pre-course learning should be completed during work.</p>  
<p>Nearly half of all respondents—including 80% of the <em>Least Likely Group</em>—forgot  
to start their pre-course learning despite intending to complete it. This finding  
suggests learners need help to narrow their intention-action gap.<br>  
<br>  
<br>  
</p>  
<p><strong class="whitetext">3. <em>Least Likely Group</em> thought not completing pre-course learning was a norm.</strong></p>  
<p>69% of the Least Likely Group agreed that there was no point in finishing  
their pre-course learning because many participants would not finish it. This  
perceived social norm could be damaging if trainers forgo discussion time to  
go through the pre-course learning again during in-class sessions.</p>  
<p><strong class="yellowstrong">MOTIVATION BARRIERS</strong></p>  
<p><strong class="whitetext">4. <em>Least Likely Group</em> believed there were no consequences of not completing  
their pre-course learning.</strong></p>  
<p>71% of the <em>Least Likely Group </em>indicated that it did not matter if they complete  
their pre-course learning because they believed the trainer would go through  
the same content during the in-class session. This perpetuates the notion that  
pre-course learning doesn’t matter.</p>  
<p><strong class="whitetext">5. <em>Least Likely Group</em> and <em>Moderately Likely Group </em>perceived the benefits  
of pre-course learning to be low and the cost of completing pre-course  
learning to be high.</strong></p>  
<p>Only a minority of the <em>Least Likely Group </em>and <em>Moderately Likely Group</em> felt that  
they could remember what they had learnt through their pre-course learning  
at CSC. This perceived lack of benefit could reinforce negative perceptions of  
pre-course learning and lower learners’ motivations.</p>  
<p style="text-align: left;">While 70% of all respondents reported doing their pre-course learning outside  
working hours, a majority of the <em>Least Likely Group</em> and <em>Moderately Likely  
Group </em>felt that they should not do so. These findings suggest a gap between  
organisational expectations, which assumes learners are willing to learn in their  
private time, and learner’s expectations, in which such learning is regarded as  
a personal cost.<br>  
<br>

<br>  
Overall, most learners faced some forms of barriers even for the <em>Most Likely Group</em> (see  
Figure 1). Unsurprisingly, the <em>Least Likely Group </em>struggled with the most barriers and it  
was the only group with the Capability barrier.<br>

<h3>CLOSING THE INTENTION-ACTION GAP</h3>  
  
<p>The CSC study found that closing the  
intention-action gap was a common  
challenge for many learners: nearly half  
of all respondents said that they forgot  
to complete their pre-course learning  
despite having intentions to do so. This  
was further compounded by busyness  
at work and reluctance of both the <em>Least  
Likely Group</em> and <em>Moderately Likely  
Group </em>to spend their personal time on  
pre-course learning.</p>  
  
<p>What can be done to address these barriers  
to learning? The following interventions  
include a combination of what different  
teams in CSC have tried and possible  
nudges to change behaviour.</p>  
  
<p><strong>1. Set deadlines for the same week  
to nudge learners to act “now”  
instead of “later”</strong></p>  
  
<p>Tu and Soman have found that people  
tend to think about time in categories (e.g., week, month, year) instead of  
thinking about it continuously.<sup><a href="#notes">7</a></sup> As a  
result, people are more likely to complete  
a task with a deadline set in the same  
week as compared to a deadline set  
next week, despite having a shorter  
time to complete it. A CSC study in  
2020 found that setting the pre-course  
learning deadline on the Friday of the  
same week as the notification email was  
sent out contributed to increasing the  
completion rate of pre-course learning.

nudges could lower participants’ barriers to completing their online pre-course learning component.</p>

<h3 class="title">Nudge to Learn:<sup>1</sup> An Email Experiment to Improve Online Learning Completion Rate for Blended Workshops<sup>2</sup></h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Researchers at CSC conducted an email experiment in 2019 to study if behavioural  
nudges could lower participants’ barriers to completing their online pre-course  
learning component. The experiment was carried out for participants of two  
different courses. They divided participants into two groups, with one (Control)  
group receiving a notification email with instructions for the online learning  
component. The other (Treatment) group received a modified notification email  
that included the following nudges aimed at increasing the likelihood of them  
completing the task:</p>  
<ul>  
<li>A “\[For Your Action\]” call to action was inserted in the email subject line to  
    increase saliency that participants act after reading the email. This was especially  
    tailored to public officers who are familiar with calls to action in email subject lines.</li>  
</ul>  
<ul>  
<li>The deadline was set on the Friday of the same week as when the participant  
    received the notification email.<sup>3</sup> In contrast, the Control group’s deadline was set  
    to the next week, giving them more time (i.e., around two weeks) to complete their  
    online learning.</li>  
</ul>  
<ul>  
<li>Only the duration for each online module was indicated, without showing the total  
    amount of time needed to complete all modules. This was to lower the perceived  
    time cost of completing the task.</li>  
</ul>  
<p style="text-align: left;">The experiment found that around 23% more participants in the Treatment  
group completed their online learning before the given deadline compared  
to the Control group (44% versus 21%). Furthermore, 25% more participants  
in the Treatment group than Control group participants completed the online  
learning before the workshop (88% versus 63%).<br>

<p><strong>2. Send email reminders but keep  
them as simple as possible</strong></p>  
  
<p>It was evident from the 2021 CSC study that learners needed help to narrow their  
intention-action gap. Furthermore, 59% of all respondents indicated that they needed  
regular reminders to complete their pre-course learning. Sending simple regular  
email reminders could help participants narrow this intention-action gap.</p>  
  
<p><strong>3. Set aside time during the workshop for pre-course learning</strong></p>  
  
<p>Not every learner has the privilege to  
learn in their own time even if they want  
to. Trainers could set aside protected  
time for adult learners to complete their  
pre-course learning during working hours,  
especially if the learning is primarily for  
work purposes. Learners would still have  
some autonomy to learn at their desired  
pace within the time provided during the workshop, without using their personal  
time to do so. In the 2021 CSC study, 73%  
of all respondents agreed that there should  
be protected time for pre-course learning.</p>  
  
<p>When several CSC programmes  
incorporated this approach, participants  
were observed to put in more effort in  
completing their pre-course learning  
compared to having them finish the  
pre-course learning in their own time.</p>

<h3 class="title">Simple Email Reminders Work Best</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>An experiment conducted by Iryna Nikolayeva et al. in a blended university course  
setting tested the effectiveness of sending weekly email reminders to help students  
overcome procrastination and complete their quizzes. Students were randomly  
assigned to the control condition (no email) or one of the treatment conditions,  
with different email content (such as the level of personalisation).</p>  
<p>The study found simple non-personalised email reminders (<em>“Hello, as a reminder,  
the next deadline for quizzes is on the DD/MM/YY! You can view them here.  
All the best for future work!”</em>) to be effective in helping students complete more  
quizzes throughout the course.</p>  
<p>Furthermore, the simple non-personalised reminders were more effective than  
complex personalised reminders (which included the student’s name, reminder, a  
summary of the student’s recent results, advice to seek support from peers and  
teachers, and a reflection exercise). The researchers hypothesised that providing  
students with too much information demotivates them from taking action.<sup>1</sup></p>

<h3>HELPING <em>LEAST LIKELY GROUP </em>COMPLETE THEIR PRE-COURSE LEARNING</h3>  
  
<p>Unlike the other groups of learners, the <em>Least Likely Group</em> faced additional  
barriers. A number of behavioural interventions offer possible ways to address these.</p>  
  
<p><strong>1. Use social norms</strong></p>  
  
<p>Social norm nudges could be used  
to encourage the <em>Least Likely Group  
</em>to complete their pre-course learning,  
since they tend to be influenced by how  
they think others behave.</p>

<p>A published 2021 study on a leading Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs)  
platform in China sought to determine the effectiveness of call-to-action  
messages on MOOCs users’ completion of course assignments before the due  
date. Four types of call-to-action messages were tested:</p>  
<p><strong>1. Simple reminder.</strong></p>  
<p>Students were notified about the start of their assignment and encouraged to submit their assignment as soon as possible.</p>  
<p><strong>2. Deadline reminder.</strong></p>  
<p>On top of the simple reminder, students were also informed of the assignment’s due date.</p>  
<p><strong>3. Social norm.</strong></p>  
<p>On top of the simple reminder, the message also mentioned the proportion of the student’s peers who had completed the assignment thus far.</p>  
<p><strong>4. Financial incentive.</strong></p>  
<p>On top of the simple reminder, students were notified that they would be entered into a lottery to stand a chance of winning an unspecified  
monetary gift if they complete the assignment on time.</p>  
<p>The social norm nudge significantly increased the probability of participants completing the assignments before the  
deadline compared to the simple reminder.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p><strong>2. Highlight the consequences of not completing pre-course learning</strong></p>  
  
<p>A majority of the <em>Least Likely Group  
</em>indicated that they did not remember  
much of what they learnt through  
CSC’s pre-course learning and believed  
there were no consequences for not  
completing it. More learners may  
complete their pre-course learning  
if we highlight the consequences of  
not doing so (e.g., “without finishing  
your pre-course learning, you will  
find it difficult to understand what is taught in the course”) instead of the  
gains (e.g., “completing the pre-course  
learning will help you understand what  
is taught in the course”).</p>  
  
<p>Research in other educational settings  
has shown that highlighting losses  
(consequences) is effective in improving  
learning outcomes. This is due to a  
behavioural bias called loss aversion,  
which refers to a tendency for people  
to react more strongly to losses over  
gains of the same amount.<sup><a href="#notes">8</a></sup></p>

<p>3. Improve self-regulation</p>  
  
<p>Research has shown that learners with higher levels of self-regulation  
(e.g., recognising that learning is their personal responsibility) learn more  
effectively in a flipped classroom.<sup><a href="#notes">9</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#notes">10</a></sup></p>  
  
<p>Of all the barriers faced by the <em>Least Likely Group</em>, their challenge of learning independently is most worrying. They may find it difficult to self-regulate and make adjustments to their learning  
process to achieve learning goals.<sup><a href="#notes">11</a></sup> Not all learners are homogeneous; we need  
a better understanding of this group’s challenges to implement pre-course learning better. </p>

<h3 class="title">Self-Efficacy and Help-Seeking Strategies Affect Self-Regulation</h3>  
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p>A study published in 2018 by Sun et al. sought to determine the self-regulatory factors  
affecting learning achievement in a flipped undergraduate Mathematics course of  
a US university.<sup>1</sup></p>  
<p>Students with stronger belief in their ability (self-efficacy) in mathematics had  
better metacognitive (strategies to process information during learning) and  
environmental strategies (strategies to learn in a conducive environment). Highly  
self-efficacious students were also more likely to obtain higher achievements in  
their pre-class and in-class learning.</p>  
<p>The study also found that help-seeking strategies had a positive effect: students  
who sought more help from others obtained higher grades for their pre-class  
learning. For better learning outcomes, the researchers suggested providing a  
platform for students to seek help from peers and trainers, and encouraging a  
culture where students were more comfortable seeking help from each other.</p>  
<p>Building a student’s confidence in the subject area, as well as providing positive  
feedback on their progress and letting students observe how others solve the  
problems, were suggested as ways to increase student self-efficacy.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>  
  
<p>Strategies to improve blended learning have  
been traditionally focused on designing the  
learning experience, curating the content  
of pre-course learning and paying attention  
to how it complements in-class sessions  
for blended learning. What actually goes  
into the implementation of pre-course  
learning has been given less attention. This  
is sometimes due to our assumptions of  
what pre-course learning should be (e.g.,  
participants learning flexibly in their own  
time) and assumptions we have about  
adult learners (e.g., they can adapt easily  
to be independent learners).</p>  
  
<p>The 2021 CSC study prompts us to rethink  
these assumptions and question if current  
approaches of blended learning are set  
up for the best outcomes, given the  
expectation of learning outside of work  
and the difficulties of balancing work and  
personal commitments. We should be  
aware that some adult learners need more  
help to learn independently: solving this  
problem is not only about their motivation  
but their capability as well. Even those  
with high motivation need help to follow  
through with their intentions.</p>  
  
<p>For better outcomes, pre-course learning  
needs to be implemented in a behaviourally  
compatible way. It is only when we break  
down the behavioural barriers to precourse learning and find ways to improve  
the implementation, that working adult  
learners can fully benefit from the blended  
learning model. In this regard, behavioural  
interventions could make a difference.</p>
