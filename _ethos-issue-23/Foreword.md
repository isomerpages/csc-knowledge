<p>This year, the Civil Service College  
marks its 20th year since becoming  
a statutory board in 2001. </p>  
  
<p>In demographic terms, being 20 years  
old means we are coming of age as  
part of ‘Generation Z’: born in the  
age of the Internet and accustomed  
to an environment marked by rapid  
technological advancements and  
other disruptive changes, such as  
the current pandemic.</p>  
  
<p>Certainly, transformative change has  
been part and parcel of our journey  
so far. As a College, we have been  
continually reinventing ourselves to  
keep pace with the changing needs of  
the Public Service. To do so, we set up  
new departments and business units. We  
have expanded the number and range  
of our programmes, initiatives and other  
offerings exponentially, reaching out to  
public officers at all levels and in every  
sphere. Apart from our evolving slate  
of leadership milestone programmes,  
we now have dedicated programmes  
for functional leaders in HR, Finance,  
Procurement, Public Communications  
and Service Management, as well as  
for sectoral leaders in the economy-building, security and social sectors.  
We are paying ever greater attention  
to helping participants become better  
leaders in their own areas of work, and  
delivering more customised offerings to  
support intact teams and organisational  
transformation.</p>  
  
<p>As befits the digitally native Gen Z spirit,  
the College has been finding innovative  
ways to embrace new modalities of  
learning. We started up our digital  
learning business, introduced virtual  
classrooms, and developed the LEARN  
app to let every officer learn at their  
own pace and in their own time, 24/7.  
We took new approaches to content  
design and delivery. Recognising data  
is the new currency, we have invested in  
new ways to manage and apply learning  
data, and we now have dedicated teams  
exploring how we can harness artificial  
intelligence to improve learning and  
development.</p>  
  
<p>In an age of disruption, the most enduring  
competence is the ability to stay agile  
and keep learning. This ethos of continual  
discovery has fuelled our drive to innovate  
and experiment in order to do better. A  
tangible instance of this is our satellite  
campus INN x CSC, which we set up as  
a sandbox to explore multisensory and  
flexible learning experiences.</p>  
  
<p>As our environment changes from day  
to day, the Public Service must stay  
deeply curious about the world around  
us—to make sense of what is happening,  
figure out how it impacts Singapore and  
hence our work, and then pick up the  
skills needed to adapt to and thrive in  
new circumstances.</p>  
  
<p>Towards this end, the College has  
embarked on a transformation effort  
to make the learning experience we  
offer to public officers more <em>innovative</em>,  
<em>inspiring</em>, and <em>impactful</em>. We call this  
movement: <strong>Learning Redefined</strong>. To  
do this, the College must itself be  
transformed at the core: to become  
more anticipatory, connected, and agile.</p>  
  
<p>The insights in this commemorative issue  
of ETHOS—which explores the future  
of learning as it applies to our Public  
Service—contribute to this ongoing  
conversation and learning journey. Our  
vision is to become the future-ready  
centre of learning for a forward-looking  
Singapore Public Service, so we can  
better serve the thriving Singapore  
of tomorrow, for generations to come.</p>  
  
<p>At the Civil Service College, we look  
forward to working with you on this  
ongoing quest.</p>
