<p>Do you start the year with a long list of resolutions, only to find yourself sticking to none of them as the weeks go by?</p>

<p>Many of us start our year listing all the things we want to change or start doing. But often, this just leads to a greater chance that we will not accomplish _anything_ on the list.</p>
