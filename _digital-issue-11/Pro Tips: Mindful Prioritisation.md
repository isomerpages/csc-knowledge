<h3>Committing to one meaningful change at a time is more effective than trying to accomplish too many things at once.</h3>

<p>Do you start the year with a long list of resolutions, only to find yourself sticking to none of them as the weeks go by?</p>

<p>Many of us start our year listing all the things we want to change or start doing. But often, this just leads to a greater chance that we will not accomplish _anything_ on the list.</p>

<p>Trying to make too many big changes at once or in too many areas of our lives (e.g., work, relationships, health, etc.) is usually a recipe for failure.</p>

<p>Instead, you may find it better to aim for one small concrete change and sticking to it. What is most important is to choose and commit to a change that is most aligned to your values and aspirations.</p>

<h3>What Prioritising Really Means</h3>

<p>The word _priority_ is derived from the Old French _priorite_, meaning "state of being earlier (than something else), prior occurrence or existence", and the Latin _prioritas_, meaning “first in rank, order, or dignity”. There can only be one first thing—one priority. As Greg McKeown explains in his book _Essentialism,_ the illogical notion that we can have multiple priorities, or more than one ‘first thing’, came about only relatively recently. When many things are given priority, in fact nothing is.</p>

<p>It would be like highlighting all the text in a textbook: which would defeat the purpose of highlighting anything at all.</p>

<p>When making resolutions, what’s needed is an actual priority: one item considered more important than the others on the list. This also applies to work: what is really _the most_ important thing? We need to be especially mindful of this when workloads increase and we find our to-do lists getting longer and longer.</p>

  
<h3>How to prioritise</h3>	

<div class="grid-container">
	
<p>One tool to help prioritise tasks is the Eisenhower Box, which is featured in Stephen Covey's widely read 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. You might also know it as The Time Management Matrix, The Eisenhower Method, or The Urgent-Important Matrix.</p>

<p>The idea is to focus on what will make you most effective, not just most productive.</p>

<p>According to the framework, all day-to-day tasks and bigger projects fall into one of four quadrants, depending on how urgent and important they are.</p>


<p>Urgent tasks are those which are externally driven, usually by deadlines. They require immediate attention but spending too much time on them (also known as ‘firefighting’) can lead to stress and anxiety, causing you to lose sight of the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Tasks are considered important based on what matters to you personally. Such tasks contribute to your long-term goals and call for more thoughtful planning and action. As these tasks may not produce immediate results, they often tend to get neglected when your time is consumed by urgent demands.</p>
