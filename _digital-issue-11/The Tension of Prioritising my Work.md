<h4>How can we balance the need to refocus work efforts while committing to and persevering on long-term work goals?</h4>

<h3>The Overthinking Trap</h3>


<p>In preparing for my year-end Appraisal and Development Plan discussion with my supervisor, I felt apprehensive as I reflected on how I had refocused my efforts away from certain workstreams that I had planned at the start of the year. My supervisor knows about these changes from our frequent check-ins and understood the need for me to reprioritise to stay productive. Yet, having to broach this topic during the discussion was unnerving. Negative thoughts ran through my head:</p>


<p><em>“Deprioritising my projects will cast doubt on my capabilities to follow through on projects.”</em></p>


<p><em>"Having projects that get deprioritised means that I was working on unimportant projects.”</em></p>


<p><em>“Shifting the focus of my efforts halfway through demonstrates a lack of perseverance and commitment.”</em></p>


<p><em>“If I had planned well, deprioritising any of my projects would not be necessary. Does this imply that I did not plan well at the start?”</em></p>


<p><em>“Stopping the project after so much effort had been invested is a waste of resources! Am I managing resources as best as I can?”</em></p>


<p>For instance, important projects might be halted for many reasons, that have nothing to do with my capabilities, due to factors well outside my control. Had these negative thoughts taken hold, they might have affected attempts to prioritise my workstreams, leading me to sustain efforts that may already be irrelevant at the cost of new, more promising initiatives, or to my overall performance and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Similarly, if supervisors or leaders believe that having to choose between workstreams shows poor planning or incompetence, they may push to deliver on new initiatives while striving to complete past projects. Collectively, this could cascade to hinder whole-of-government (WOG) moves to shift national priorities, as agencies continue to invest resources in outdated projects due to legacy or sunk costs.</p>


<h3>Contending with Tension</h3>

<p>The truth is that, given our increasingly dynamic context, it has become nearly impossible to anticipate when the best laid plans may have to be set aside. For example, a project’s scope could have grown larger than anticipated as stakeholders’ interests grew. New and more urgent tasks may have arisen, or unforeseen disruptions (such as a global pandemic) may upend our lives and work.</p>

<p>We must contend with the tension&nbsp;between knowing when we ought to remain committed and persevere on projects and realising it is time to reprioritise.</p>

<p>This may be easier said than done. We may have to manage the expectations of stakeholders—including ourselves and our teams—when letting go of projects that have been invested with much time and effort, and to which we have become attached.</p>

<p>To overcome such personal barriers to reprioritising our work, we might adopt these three approaches: <b>Reflect</b>, <b>Review</b>, and <b>Reframe.</b></p>


<p style="color:#2E5396;font-weight:bold"><b><u>Reflect:</u></b> Take a step back and consider the overall purpose of the team, and where your work fits in</p>

<p>We can be more intentional and systematic in thinking about how best to achieve our organisational priorities while making the most of available resources.</p>

<p>To support this thinking, colleagues in the Institute of Leadership and Organisation Development in the Civil Service College have developed a S.C.A.L.E. framework, based on data and insights gleaned through their work on organisational transformation with various public agencies. (Read: how to prioritise using the S.C.A.L.E. framework).</p>


<p>“S” in the S.C.A.L.E. framework stands for “Strategy”. Being clear about the strategic purpose of our work unit is key to resolving the tension of prioritisation. We each need to go back to what our core purpose and mandate are, and appreciate the unique value that our unit brings. We need to ask ourselves: what is it that our unit can (and should) do, that others cannot?  A team might also ask itself how its work contributes to the whole: where does it fit in? Answering these questions can help a team achieve better clarity of purpose, making it easier to determine whether a given piece of work is essential to achieving its mandate.</p>


<p style="color:#2E5396;font-weight:bold"><b><u>Review</u></b> each project’s relevance regularly </p>

<p>Most projects are reviewed at regular intervals. At each of these reviews, make it a point to consider whether the project is meeting stakeholders’ needs, and whether it is still relevant to the current context, which may be starkly different from when the project was conceived. The scope of the project could then be modified to adapt to new circumstances, or even deprioritised altogether, in a timelier manner. </p>


<p style="color:#2E5396;font-weight:bold"><b><u>Reframe</u></b> negative thoughts.</p>

<p>One of the ways we can deal with work anxieties is to reframe them as more helpful thoughts. There are three steps to this:</p>


<ol>
	<li>Notice the thought </li>
	<dl>Take note of the thoughts that cause you to feel discouraged.</dl>
	
<li>Question/challenge the thought </li>
<dl>What are the assumptions underlying the thought? Are they reasonable? Think of evidence that disproves some of the negative assumptions— these could come from past experiences, or from observing your colleagues.</dl>
	
<li>Reframe the thought </li>
<dl>What are some ways to think about the situation that is also true, but more helpful?</dl>
	
</ol>


<p>Here are some examples of how negative thoughts might be reframed:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Original negative thought </th>
    <th>Questioning</th>
    <th>Reframing</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>“Deprioritising my projects will cast doubt on my capabilities to follow through on projects.”</em></td>
    <td><em>“Sarah had projects that were deprioritised, but her supervisor still thinks highly of her capabilities!” </em></td>
    <td><em>“There are other projects that I have worked on that equally demonstrate my capabilities.” </em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>“Having projects that get deprioritised means that I was working on unimportant projects.” </em></td>
    <td><em>“Do only unimportant projects get deprioritised?” </em></td>
    <td><em>“Having a deprioritised project does not mean it is unimportant, it could just mean that the other project is more time-sensitive.” </em></td>
  </tr>
  
</tbody>
</table>

	













<p>An example of this is the way we deal with security. We develop a complex set of rules for everyone to follow, and then we create a whole industry to check for compliance. It becomes easier to do an audit rather than to trust the employee. But there are now better ways to ensure security if we adopted a policy of trust, such as with deliberate penetration testing, for example. Tech companies automate a lot of their processes, even using systems to check code for vulnerabilities by default.</p>

<p>Many widely available tools and approaches already meet 90% of our work needs. Instead of customising our own system to fit all our specialised requirements, we could adjust our policies to allow most of those needs to be fulfilled by readymade platforms, and then taking care of the last 10% or so separately. We do not have to reinvent the wheel, nor do we have to compromise our particular needs.</p>

<p>For instance, we are trying to shift out the sensitive elements of our Government work laptops, leaving a machine that is not commingled with sensitive data. We may no longer need a VPN to use them, and we would be able to enable public officers to enjoy the full functionality of the web. This would liberate public officers to use more commercial software services and applications to their fullest potential.</p>

<p>Technology has so far created much more work for us than saved it. The next step is to use its potential to streamline and speed up our work. Once we free up our policies to enable broader adoption of widely available new tools and processes, we can unleash a new wave of innovation in the public sector.</p>

<p>We do not yet know what the full possibilities are for saving resources or extracting the best public value out of them. What we will want to do is encourage our public officers to experiment and try things out. Innovation will come from a broad base of active users, especially officers at the lower levels or on the front lines. For technical power users in specific agencies, we can customise domain-specific innovations: using machine learning to summarise judgements for the Attorney-General’s Chambers, for instance, or to draw up contracts.</p>

<h3>Freeing up time to think differently</h3>

<p>In the face of a digital overload and decision deluge, the tendency is to fall back to habit, past experience and instinct in making decisions. There is little time to ask more than shallow questions. In the long run, this leads to suboptimal judgements. Being more efficient in our work processes is not just about spinning our wheels faster. It should also free up more time for us to think about whether we need to do different things.

For instance, now that the Covid situation is allowing us back into our workplaces, we should be mindful that when we bring people back into the office, there has to be a reason other than for formal meetings that could have been resolved by email. These are things we can and should reduce. Nor should we just blindly follow a formula of having three days in and two days out. Instead, we should be deliberate in using that office time to do things that are best done in person, face-to-face, such as brainstorming or team building.

In his book Deep Work, American author and computer scientist Cal Newport writes about a movement in workplaces to have focus days, where staff turn off their computers to think and work. He writes about remote organisations which are good at protecting their staff’s private time. Performance is still judged by outcomes, but there is a cadence to work where say one works two months remotely and then comes together with colleagues for two weeks. We should be thinking about how best to allow our officers the time and space to do deep work.

Workload bloat and organisational complexity create bottlenecks, imposes costs, and diffuses responsibility. All these take time and effort away from other important priorities. The benefit of having a lean and mean yet dedicated outfit is that you can do a lot more of what matters.


</p><h3>Getting the balance right while delivering great service</h3>

<p>
It is one thing to encourage public agencies to be more purposeful and innovative in their uses of resources, including their officers’ time. It is quite another when changing priorities mean we may have to start dropping programmes and taking away resources. This will be a difficult but necessary pill to swallow.</p>

<p>But this will not mean that we need compromise on doing our jobs to serve the public well. Take the example of DBS bank, which has had to grapple with significant restructuring—they have been closing many of their bank branches and embracing online and digital services. Each bank branch closed is a pain point for the public they serve, who are accustomed to physical counters. But the bank has adopted a good middle ground, in which they close or shrink some branches, but put in place virtual counters with actual persons serving customers on screen. And you can carry out almost all the transactions you need to do in person, even though the services are being provided in a more centralised and resource-effective manner.</p>

<p>The irony is that in wanting to overprovide for important&nbsp;needs, such as caring for the elderly or vulnerable, we sometimes fall back on the easy but high-cost solutions (such as having many more physical counters) that turn out to be less sustainable in the long run. In fact, there could be more efficient ways to do the job, using technology or more simplified processes, that result in better services—if only we sought out the opportunities to do so.</p>


<h3>Staying agile in leaner times</h3>

<p>We no longer operate in an era of plenty. But even if we had all the resources in the world, organisational and workload growth can lead to bloat that actually holds us back from doing as well as we otherwise could have.</p>

<p>The world has changed but the way we organise ourselves has not. We must be more judicious in our choice of where to devote increasingly scarce resources, including our officers’ precious time. And that means conserving the bandwidth needed to process data, consider different ideas and prioritise needs carefully—to be thoughtfully pragmatic about what truly matters. This is by no means an easy challenge in an age where competing demands have proliferated and it is no longer fully clear where the trade-offs lie.</p>

<p>We will need to think carefully about how we can be more strategic in framing our priorities, rather than being reactive to every new fire that comes along. We should free up our heads and hands to do so, by adopting better discipline in our workflows, learning to do well with less, being more agile with policies and making the most of available new tools. If not, we risk having our tried and tested ways of doing things today being overwhelmed by the demands of the future.</p>
