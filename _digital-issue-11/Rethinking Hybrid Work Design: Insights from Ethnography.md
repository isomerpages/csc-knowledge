<h3>Rethinking Hybrid Work Design: Insights from Ethnography</h3>

<p>There is <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/working-paper/evolution-working-home">broad acceptance</a> that some form of hybrid work will continue after the pandemic.<sup>1</sup>  Anticipating this trend, CSC’s Institute of Leadership and Organisation Development (ILOD) developed <a href="https://gccprod.sharepoint.com/sites/CSC-LnODinsights/SitePages/The-Leader%27s-Playbook-to-Hybrid-Work.aspx?web=1">A Leader’s Playbook to Hybrid Work</a> in May 2022 to help public service agencies come to terms with this new form of working and update our ways of working.<sup>2</sup> More <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hybrid-working-model-wfh-work-from-home-policy-office-trends-2023-7">recent research by experts</a> studying work-from-home (WFH) arrangements have since validated this approach.<sup>3</sup>  </p>

<div class="containerbox">
	<p>The Hybrid Pyramid, which is part of ILOD’s Playbook, is a systemic framework highlighting key dimensions of work practices for effective hybrid work. We developed the framework with the Public Service context in mind, based on research and ground feedback from the senior management team and staff of a pilot Ministry. </p>

<p>However, despite three years of pandemic-induced working from home and hybrid working arrangements, there seems to be little consensus (and in fact there may be conflicting evidence) on whether these work models are more productive and effective than conventional office-based modes.</p>

      <p>A recent <a href="wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GSWA-2023.pdf"> global survey of working arrangements</a> observed that employers generally want more office time.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>The issue of hybrid work and its impact on ways of working is bound up with longstanding, implicit assumptions about how work is carried out.</p> 
<p>Seeking a fresh perspective, ILOD Principal Consultant Eileen Wong spoke with Thijs Willems, an organisational ethnographer and Research Fellow at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, to explore how an ethnographic lens might shed light on and help reframe today’s shifting work cultures.</p>
