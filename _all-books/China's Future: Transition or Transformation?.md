		<p>A new political leadership has taken over at the helm of the world's second largest economy. The world is watching intently, as economic, social and political tensions continue to raise questions about China's future. <br>

How will the new leadership balance China's thirst for economic growth with the need for fundamental social reforms? Can China build a "harmonious, middle class society" as it faces pushback from conflicting demands from the rich and poor, the urban and rural? Will the Chinese Communist Party heed calls for greater civic participation or will it be business-as-usual as it seeks to maintain political supremacy? <br>

In this publication, CSC researchers examine key ideas presented by experts from the Tsinghua University School of Public Policy and Management-an institution closely involved in China's governance and policy reforms. They explore insights on the likely trajectory of China's governance, economic and social developments following its leadership transition.</p>
