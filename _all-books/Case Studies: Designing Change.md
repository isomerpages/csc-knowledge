<h3>Case Studies: Designing Change</h3>
<i>ISBN: 978-981-18-2606-1 (pbk) | 2021</i><br>
<b><i>Edited by June Gwee</i></b>

<p>This book contains five case studies that describe organisation- and industry-level transformations where leaders and individuals reimagine operations, reengineer business processes, redesign service delivery models, and revamp the way they use technology, especially when some of their best-laid
plans were abruptly changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. These stories offer insights on the complexity and challenges of change, innovation and public governance.</p>
